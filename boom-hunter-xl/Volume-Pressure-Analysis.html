<h1>Volume Pressure Analysis:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Use the volume bars when you are entering a trade. They confirm entries and continuations (The bounce and the breakout)</li>
  <li>The lighter colors show how easy it is to move the price. It will fill up the bar first, once it is full, it continues from above. This usually happens as it gets pushed and pulled from SR lines.</li>
  <li>The dimmed bars are Relative Volume (RVOL). They are bars that fall under the sma20 line and have little impact on the chart.</li>
  <li>The arrows show the directional pressure that price action wants to follow. They confirm the bounces and the breakouts;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Red arrows signal downward directional pressure.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Green arrows signal upward directional pressure.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- These signals can go on and off as more data comes in. So wait near the end of a bar close for the bar to collect enough information. It uses volume, so every bar starts with zero information and collects data as it is nearing the close. The closer you are to the bar close, the more accurate the data will be. The start of a new bar does not have as accurate data as halfway through a bar or near the closing of it.</p>

<p>The light colored bars show how easy it is to move the price. Sometimes it requires very little volume to move price. These movements happen mostly around a SR line/band and shows price action getting pushed and pulled from a SR line. Because price action wants to travel this direction it is very easy to move the price. This type of analysis is great for monitoring price action getting pulled back for a test and getting an early reading on if it is getting rejected or passing.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>First the volume bar fills up (darker)&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>As volume data comes in the script calculates how easy the price is to move and will start to fill up the darker bar with the lighter bar(ease of movement)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>When ease exceeds the volume bar it continues from the top of the volume bar.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><i><strong>#3 is much easier to move than #2</strong></i></p>

  <figcaption>The current volume bar shows very little volume is needed to move the price. The red arrow shows volume directional pressure. Price action now has had a push in the downward direction.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The current volume bar will also show opposing pressure. This is displayed by the bar filling up with the opposite color. This effectively shows how hard it is to move price, when opposing pressure fills the bar you can expect price action to change directions.&nbsp;</p>

  <figcaption>Here we can see the current volume bar with very strong opposing pressure.&nbsp;</figcaption>

<h1>Volume breakout (LSMA Yellow Dots)</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The yellow dot at the top of the indicator is a Volume Breakout.</li>
  <li>Only enter at this dot if you were planning on entering the trade anyway. &nbsp;You should know the direction of the breakout already if you were planning to enter a trade.</li>
</ul>
