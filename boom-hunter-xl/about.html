<h1>What is Boom Hunter XL?</h1>
<p>Boom Hunter XL is an indicator built for the TradingView platform. Its primary purpose is to present the charts to you as accurately as possible to help you make informed decisions using your analysis and find the perfect entry for epic trades. This one-of-a-kind indicator is a genuine "Swiss Army Knife" in the sense that it allows professional traders to drop this tool on their chart and provide confluence for their existing strategies. Because Boom Hunter&nbsp;XL uses multiple lengths, it works on every time frame and offers three types of analysis:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Support and Resistance (SR) Analysis</strong>. XL's primary function is as a support and resistance oscillator, and it tracks price action through its current price channel. Not only is the fast primary oscillator suitable for entering and exiting trades, but it also draws breakout and reversal patterns. Dynamic support and resistance lines are shown so you can enter trades as it bounces from an SR line. It performs many tasks, including exposing the high and low points in channels, making it ideal for swing trading.</li>
  <li><strong>Volume Analysis.</strong> This volume indicator uses relative volume and volatility to highlight anomalies. It measures volume pressure which tells you how easy it is to move the price. Sometimes it requires a lot of volume to move the price, while other times, it requires very little. Some arrows signal directional pressure; this is the direction the price action wants to travel. On the top right, you will find volume stats are displayed, and volume breakouts are shown with a light yellow dot.</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure Analysis.</strong> Pressure is measured and shown as green and red dots, and it signals when price action is trying to break support and resistance lines and the current price channel. These pressure dots makes it easy to find pivot points and avoid bad trades.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Elements</strong></h1>
<p>Each line on this tool serves a purpose and has a unique strategy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Main Oscillator&nbsp;</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/introduction/boomhunter_intro_3.png">
  <figcaption>The main oscillator consists of 4 components</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Oscillator (White Line)</h3>
<p>The white line is the main oscillator used to enter trades, find chart reversal patterns, and isolate breakouts</p>
<h3>Trigger (Dark Gray Line)</h3>
<p>The gray line is the fastest line on Boom Hunter XL, and it acts as the trigger to find crossovers and crossunders</p>
<h3>Pressure Dots (Green and Red dots)</h3>
<p>The pressure dots show up pressure in red and down pressure in green, signaling that price action is testing an SR line. With just a little pressure, it will become a pivot, but it will break the SR line and try to push again with too much pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Price line (Red/Green dotted horizontal line)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The price line shows the level of the trigger and is used to help enter trades and see previous SR lines that are being tested.&nbsp;<br>The price line changes color. There are two oscillators on the price line, The main oscillator and the confirmation oscillator. They both have to go in the same direction to be a solid color; this can help to jump on trends or ride them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It will stay transparent green while in an uptrend, and when the oscillator moves up, it turns solid green.</li>
  <li>It will stay transparent red while in a downtrend, and when the oscillator moves down, it turns solid red.</li>
  <li>Use Back Testing Mode to see how it changes. You can find that in the settings on the Boom Hunter XL.</li>
  <li>Use the price line to determine the direction of the trend. Also, use it to see what SR it is testing and how it reacts to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Red SR Band</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/introduction/boomhunter_intro_4.png"></figure>
<p>The Red SR Band shows a dynamic SR band. A support and resistance line is a median line in the middle band. Using the expand option (see settings), traders can identify strong SR when the band gets wider. This SR band is very active and the primary dictator of price action. When the oscillator is above this line, it travels up, and below, it travels down. This line is used to enter trades as price action bounces from the red SR band. It also displays the current trend. While the red SR is traveling up, it is an uptrend; while it travels down, it is a downtrend.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gray SR Band</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/introduction/boomhunter_intro_5.png"></figure>
<p>The gray SR band is powerful, and price action tends to move with the gray line almost as if it is caught in its gravitational force â€“ continuously spinning around it and never getting too far away from it. Because of its strength, the gray line can also identify trend direction.</p>
<h2>Channel Support and Resistance</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/introduction/boomhunter_intro_6.png"></figure>
<p>The top and bottom lines show the channel support and resistance lines. When the support line (bottom) hits the ceiling (top), it signals that the price action is testing/breaking the channel's resistance line. Likewise, when the top line hits the bottom, it tests the channel's support. The price channel is dynamic and adjusts when there is a channel change.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Volume Pressure Analysis</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/introduction/boomhunter_intro_7.png"></figure>
<p>Volume&nbsp;Pressure Analysis is a new concept showing the effort required to move the price. It is an ideal tool for confirming trends or locating reversals early.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>This analysis can highlight whale action and market manipulation.</li>
  <li>It calculates volume vs. volatility and displays the results as a meter.</li>
  <li>A volume breakout detector that signals a yellow dot at the top of the indicator is included with volume analysis.</li>
  <li>The average volume is displayed in gray on the top right corner, and the current volume level is shown in teal/red text.</li>
</ul>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Correction, Retracement, Dip and Pullback</td>
        <td>These are different names for the same thing. Retracements are temporary price reversals that take place within a larger trend.&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pullup</td>
        <td>A term used for a pullback back in an up direction. This is a setup for a short. These are also called pullbacks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Reversal or Pivot</td>
        <td>A reversal is when the trend changes direction. Reversals are often characterized by patterns that are contrary such as double tops/bottoms and head and shoulders patterns. A pivot is a reversal, it is a change of direction. Look for pivots on the slower charts.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pump</td>
        <td>When price action breaks a resistance line and price goes for a fly; usually a channel resistance on a faster timeframe</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dump</td>
        <td>When price action breaks a support line and dumps down; usually channel support on a faster timeframe</td>

        <td>Breakout</td>
        <td>A break of a pattern; usually consists of a wedge between 2 SR lines</td>
