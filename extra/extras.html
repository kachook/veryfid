<h1>Tips on how to use Boom Hunter XL</h1>
<p>- Keep in mind that every long and short signal on boom hunter pro is based on a double bounce</p>
<p>- We are looking to catch trades as they bounces of the red band (most of the time). the more dots = more pull back after the bounce.</p>
<p>- You can trade every line on this indicator individually. Every line is a strategy</p>
<p>- draw patters and channels on the chart and have bias from the top down through multiple timeframes then use the Boom Hunter XL to validate and read the chart better and mark entries and exits.</p>
<p>- keep an eye one the previous high/low pivots (link in the COG indicator). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Enter trades when it does not break the previous low (long), high (short). Long entries are found every time the the lows keep getting higher. and the opposite is correct (1h is best)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Use the pivots of the indicator to draw &nbsp;support and resistance lines on the indicator itself and also on the the chart .</p>
<p>- Use Higher timeframes to find the true bottoms/tops.</p>
<p>- When the chart is about to test the channel, don't take any trades until you see a confirmation. It will either gets rejected from trying to break the channel or breaks the channel it will pull back and test before taking off</p>
<p>- In a down trend (Oscillator is going down), set up your long trades, yet still can look for epic shorts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- In an up trend (Oscillator is going up), setup your shorts, yet still can look for epic longs</p>
<p>- Trade with the daily trend. &nbsp;setup the trades on all the timeframes and line them up with each other</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- A little movement on the daily like crossing a SR are massive movements on the 1 hr. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- A bounce on the 4hr is huge on the 1 hr.</p>
<p>- Wait for the chart to establish a trend then bet with the trend and it almost impossible to loose. it will present several entries for you along a trend. &nbsp;these can be entry points and/or a place to load into your existing trade. buy the dips and sell the tops. Use multiple timeframes and you can see very easy when is good. get them all going in the same direction and look for the setup on the 1hr</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best is to use longer timeframes to find the true bottom</p>
<p>you can watch it bottom out across the timeframes, it will eventually make a pivot away from the bottom support line</p>
<p>the less pressure dots the more likely it will pivot. If there is a lot of pressure dots it is likely to pull back and push the SR line again</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>When the white line crosses under the red wait for it to come back up and test. enter as it gets rejected.</p>
<p>for a safer entry wait for it to pass the gray SR band</p>
<p>it will test before it takes off</p>

<p>--------------------------------</p>
<p>when it is not such tough resistance it just pops out</p>
<p>ok watch what happens now</p>
<p>this is a worst case scenario if you are still in the trade</p>
<p>dont close in the negative at this point</p>
<p>it is coming back to test the channel</p>
<p>at this point it looks like it will bust it</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/entries/entry.4.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>see how it is coming up</p>
<p>i would look for an exit now in profit</p>
<p>if it goes back down and breaks the channel I would wait for it to test the line then exit at a loss</p>
<p>but give it a chance</p>
<p>don't just exit in loss because it looks bad</p>
<p>let it test and bounce</p>
<p>and get an exit in profit</p>
<p>for example if i was still in red here I would still be waiting</p>
<p>even though it looks bad</p>
<p>looking bad is better than taking a loss before its finished its move</p>
<p>i would rather take a little bit more of a loss and know there is no chance</p>
<p>it hurts to take a loss and watch it fly off</p>

<p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>About the SR lines:</strong></mark></p>
<p>the Red line is a dynamic SR</p>
<p>the Gray line is a stronger less dynamic Red line and it also shows the general trend</p>
<p>They work slightly different..</p>
<p>The price action moves with the gray line like its spinning around it.</p>
<p>The price action can never get too far away from it.</p>
<p>It's sort of like a cable for electricity to run on.</p>
<p>The red line is more dynamic and plays a huge part in the price actions direction and behaviour.</p>
<p>The price action&nbsp; will either bounces off it to change directions and to make a movement, sling shot from it, bounce off it. or launch through it.</p>
<p>when the white line is above the gray line it is an up trend and when it gets pushed under its a down trend</p>
<p>Here is an example of how the Gray line shows the general trend:</p>

<p>-----------</p>
<p>question by Dawood â€”</p>
<p>there is long signal at left part of chart but the price is going down , and at this moment it will be short cause the price braking the SR to down, cant understand this part</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:74.43%;"><img src="/supports_resistances/sr.6.png"></figure>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>there are no long or short signals. it is not that kind of indicator.</p>
