<p>Price action has came back to OSC3 but could not pass = short<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OSC3 median (what you simply call OSC3) is VERY significant. what I didn't realize before is that the lower BHXL with golden ratio will keep you out of bad trades (as seen in #1) and the upper BHXL (#2) will guide you in terms of entries.. in this screenshot if I didn't have #1 set up, I might look at #2 and just want to go long.. .but if I look at #1 I'll say hey wait a minute lets wait for #2 to validate a short entry (using HTF to set the trade up)</p>

<p>osc1 = main oscillator</p>
<p>Osc2 = red SR band (off by default)</p>
<p>Osc3 = Used to be called Grey SR</p>
<p>Osc4 = roofing filter (off by default)</p>

<p>1 - broke resistance band</p>
<p>2 - first pullback (if I am right I am not sure why signal did not indicate first pullback) plus crossover = long entry</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>price action broke the resistance band so now you need to wait for it to come back and make a crossunder below the resistance band</p>
<p>also keep in mind when price action pushes hard it will want to push again</p>

<p>1. this shows SR strength increasing. when the light bars start it shows support starting to push up</p>
<p>2/3: the bars continuing to the resistance band show that SR strength is still very strong and there is a build up of pressure</p>
