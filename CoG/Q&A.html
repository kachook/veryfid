<h1>Center Of Gravity Oscillator Q&amp;A from comments</h1>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>It seems easier to identify a lot of these pivots in hindsight. Any advice for confirming the pivot in real time?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Try to setup trades on higher time frame charts so you can see the big picture. Draw your own lines.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/qGRzOBWL" alt="">
  <figcaption>This is the 12 hour BTC chart. I have drawn trend lines. The price action is currently in a bullish parallel channel (these tend to break to the upside. I also have the wedge drawn on the COG oscillator. Ideally you want to enter longs at the bottom of the parallel channel and shorts at the top. In these channels shorts are better as price is generally moving down and any short entry at top of channel is not likely to be broken until channel is broken.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So for now we know this is where we are at until it breaks:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it is in parallel channel it has narrowed it down to only 2 options...&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xPGwWhEe" alt="">
  <figcaption>It can either break up or down. Either way it will flip the axis of the the channel and head in same direction. With these lines I can setup trades well in advance and just use the COG as a confirmation.</figcaption>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I prefer the clean look of COG. That and I don't fully understand Boom Hunter Pro. I've gotten very in-tune with CoG and it's helped my chart reading skills.</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>In my opinion COG is the best indicator for reading charts and its great to hear you are comfortable with it. Boom hunter pro uses CoG with filters. It works as a short term CoG to highlight bottoms and tops. In my opinion it is by far the best indicator for finding entries, exits and riding trends.</p>
<p>Check out these incredible entries:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is purpose of the long shadow?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> it shows the previous high and low. The best thing about this indicator is the ability to show support and resistance lines. For an example, if it cant break previous high there is a good chance there will be a good short.</p>
<p>Here is an example with COG set to length of 50:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Do you have a preference (lately) of CoG or Boom Pro? Boom features an adaptation of CoG, right? I've been comparing them today, but can't decide - there were some different signals at times.</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I use both CoG and Boom Pro for different things. Boom will show support and resistance level within a trend but no further than that. CoG will show on going levels. In this screenshot you can see how at each boom it has recorded a new low point on the CoG. Each low does not break the previous low which indicates an up trend.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/qvQGuEu0" alt=""></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an example of the support line being broken in a down trend:&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/WfBmodLA" alt="">
  <figcaption>In these examples I am using COG with length of 9 and smoothing length of 9.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>CoG is better than boom for reading charts and determining the next move. Boom is better at finding entries and riding trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try look for parallel channels for the biggest breakouts. Also try connect 3 or more tops or bottoms to find breakouts.</p>

<p><br>A simple way with boom hunter is to check the low pivots:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/lgu8SrjO" alt=""></figure>
<p><br>Another easy way is with COG, use clean theme then turn off all the lines in the style options but COG trend line. Set length to 50 and use smoothing with length of 3:</p>
