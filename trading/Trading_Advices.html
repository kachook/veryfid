<h1>Trading tips</h1>
<p>- The most important thing to remember is to always go with the trend. Always look what the 4hr is doing. If 4 hour is in up trend look for longs on the 1 hour, if it is in a reversal wait. if it is in a down trend, look for shorts. The best trades to catch are shorts in a downtrend and longs in an uptrend.</p>
<p>- Think before you enter any trade. Think about the other possibilities of the trade and think about the bigger picture using MTF analysis. And most importantly, think about other trades that are against you too.</p>
<p>- It's all about getting perfect entries. Nothing else matters really. Once you start entering the good trades, Boom Trades, it will be all you want.</p>
<p>- Don't bother paper trading, It is like playing poker without money. If you want to practice trading make a real trade but very very little amount. Traders can often convince themselves that it is definitely going bull or for sure it will turn bear. It gets to the point where they will fight anyone who says otherwise. &nbsp;There are only two choices, up or down, this makes it easy to prepare for both options no matter what happens. Even if your analysis is wrong, you can still be prepared for the other move and can trade accordingly.</p>
<p>- It is important to learn patience. Many traders are in a hurry to make profits.</p>
<p>- Emotions: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; The biggest emotion to overcome is the fear of loosing out. It is easy to feel like you are missing the good trades but remember it always comes back for more entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; The second-biggest emotion to overcome is greed. Traders can stay in trades too long hoping for another boom, only for it to dump on them loosing all their profit.</p>
<p>- You only need to worry about trend if you try to ride the whole trend, if you are entering the break, trend is not important.</p>
<p>- Wait for the trend to be established and bet with it.</p>
<p>- Use diversions (hard to read when in a reversal). If the boom is going down and the price action is going up on the chart, there is a chance for a pump into a dump. And the opposite is correct.</p>
<p>- You have to treat your account like it is a big account!</p>
<p>- When trading Boom trads, DON'T use stop losses, because of the spikes and stop loss hunting. Stop Loss is a take loss! You can just exit if its not good trade or exit at a good place and in profit. Just put the Stop Loss near your liquidation price. Use them as take profits not as take losses</p>
<p>- Sometime, the retest after the real break of the trend line can pull all the way down before taking off</p>
<p>- If you miss the trade, just wait. It'll comes back</p>
<p>- If you enter early, you will get punished. Be patient and enter on on confirmation. An early entry is like picking a race horse before a race! I prefer to wait until they get around the first corner before I place a bet.</p>
<p>- If you made the mistake, let your trade play out before you close it.</p>
<p>- If you want to go for an early entry, entry with a small amount, then limp in and load in after the confirmation. Then another load in when it confirms again</p>
<p>- Don't bother checking anything but your trend lines. tinker on the breakout to the perfect entry. Draw lines on your charts to help you get the big picture, do not just rely on boom hunter.</p>
<p>- Use multi time frame analysis. Because, you could enter a short trades on shorter timeframes but it's &nbsp;just a pullback for the longer charts. in this case, the short setup on the higher time frame is more important than the long trades on the Lower timeframes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Don't enter a short trade into a pullback. It will bounce back up on you. Enter booms instead</p>
<p>- Once you enter a trade just stick with it. At some point it will confirm yes or no. Never ever exit until confirmation</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; If its a NO, look for exit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; If it is a YES, load into it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Never trade on an empty stomach. it affects your trading emotions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Never go short as it is breaking a channel or a SR line or after the first bull run. Wait and see what happen. It will either fly off or it will pull right back to retest the line and get rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;Either Take Profit at the top and get back in as it flies or pull out some positions at the top, TP1, and load them back in at the bottom as it breaks.</p>
<p>- When trading a boom, don't trade more than 10x and 10% of your trading account</p>
<h1>More advice</h1>
<p>It is important to learn patience. Many traders are in a hurry to make profits.</p>
<p>1. The biggest emotion to overcome is the fear of loosing out. It is easy to feel like you are missing the good trades but remember it always comes back for more entries.</p>
<p>2. The second biggest emotion to overcome is greed. Traders can stay in trades too long hoping for another boom, only for it to dump on them loosing all their profit</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rule #1 no reversal (unless you are about to do short term trades, scalping style)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I used to trade them all the time. I was obsessed with getting the lowest entry possible. its such a dangerous point! with or without a stop loss. I've been stopped out at these points many times then it flies off. and those times it literally kisses the stop loss line and takes off lol</p>
<p>I remember at one point having a stop loss that was not a market order. I got dumped on and my stop loss didn't work lol</p>
<p>this is something that every trader should train, we always want to pick tops and bottoms. i have rule, i only enter long when price broke the big bear pivot.</p>
<p>it might take weeks for some reversals to clean up, then come the good trades</p>
<p>after making hundreds of trades you will come to find that its not worth your time and stress entering a reversal</p>
<p>you will eventually be patient and wait for the good entries and load into those trades</p>
<p>and you will eventually loose the fear of missing out because you will understand it always comes back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rule #2&nbsp; Only enter at an entry point</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rule #3 Always look for the first pullback after the reversal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rule#4 Stop using stop losses</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; just relax and be smart about it</p>
<p>you are not missing anything</p>
<p>stop losses were designed to take money from retailers</p>
<p>its a false sense of security</p>
<p>but can be used to your advantage</p>
<p>a smart trader that uses stop losses keeps them well out off the action and at a point the trade if for sure invalid</p>
<p>a new trader set their stop loss tight with no breathing room</p>
<p>and at a point that the trade is still valid</p>
<p>I'm not say stop losses are terrible, I just don't like them and don't need them unless I scalp</p>
<p>I much prefer to exit on my own terms</p>
<p>When you learn something new, go back test it and look for it yourself</p>
<p>try to understand what is happening on the chart</p>
<p>it is always bouncing between SR lines</p>
<p>It will take time, once you enter some good entries you will understand</p>
<p>but we have to wait for them to come</p>
<p>if you enter at a real entry point you go straight into profit and stay that way</p>
<p>when the reversal completes it will clean up and i will bet hard</p>
<p>only enter when an entry presents itself</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/trading_advices/trading_advices_1.png"></figure>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>Start with day trading. lots of new traders get to a point they want to go pro! So, they say they are a day trader.&nbsp;<br>that means it is their 9-5 job and must make trades everyday. that is where they go wrong.&nbsp;<br>Trades come when they come not when you want.</p>
<p>people get stuck in the mindset that they have to trade every movement</p>
<p>Don't get stuck on these silly things that don't make sense like "I've made enough today" when its pumping its pumping.</p>
<p>you play the cards you are dealt so don't go all in on nothing</p>
<p>set up your trades in advance so you already know what you are looking for and if it comes you hit it.</p>
<p>if it didn't come, you wait.</p>
<p>Sometime the trade is a cross road, it could be a good short or good long. In these moments, you prepare for both and enter on confirmation.</p>
<p>Patience is the key.<br>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Everyone has their favorite kinds of trades</p>
<p>I personally look at it like roulette. There is a choice of red or black. the punter picks a color and the wheel spins. When I trade, I wait for the wheel to stop spinning so i know what color it is also what number. then I bet large</p>
<p>These trades come every 2-8 weeks and they come by 2-3 trades in a row</p>
<p>Enter into profit and watch it break bybit (or whatever exchange you are using)<br>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Keep note of the signals on Boom Hunter and after a few times you will be able to trust them. Patience is the key.</p>
<p>If they are not obvious on the timeframe you are on, scroll through the time frames until you find one that shows it the best.</p>
<p>Once you know exactly what you are looking for, you will start to see it everywhere</p>
<p>Check out 4,5 and 6hr</p>
<p>when it crosses under on these longer frames look for good action on faster</p>
<p>setting up a trade on 1h or 4h chart means you can enter from a faster timeframe&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering from a faster time frame can get you a better entry. But you also run the risk of entering too early if you don't analyze the longer time frame correctly</p>
<p>-------------------------------</p>
<p>Most important thing other than a perfect entry is that you can do all sorts of tricks like pull out half your positions as it pulls back and re-enter them with your profits and max it out</p>
<p>that way you still keep your good entry so its easy to enter the pullback</p>
<p>until you have done the same trade over and over stick to small amount</p>
<p>10% is a huge investment for a big investor</p>
<p>but for someone that doesn't have millions of dollers, &nbsp;I understand you want to bet a bit more but don't go higher than 10%</p>
<p>just keep loading into your trade as it keeps confirming you can end up with half your stack in the trade with no risk</p>
<p>the less leverage you use the looser you can be with your stop loss</p>
<p>its nicer to be able to relax and not worry about getting stopped out</p>
<p>i do insane leverage sometime but with a small bet and only on certain trades that I have done hundreds of times before</p>
<p>I do not use SL.&nbsp;<br>When you get used to the indicator you just exit at the top for along or bottom for short</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>Is there anything you use or can recommend for confluencing targets?</p>
<p>I just read the indcators through the timeframes</p>
<p>depends on the trade, if you are riding a trend it is different to scalping a candle</p>
<p>I like to ride trends on the 4hr but I use the 1 hr for trends in that trend and then use whatever timeframe is best at the time</p>
<p>I also use trend lines, break lines, and channels</p>
<p>this is what to look for:</p>
<p>use 1 hr chart and scroll back. Look for things like this</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/image.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically u want to start preparing for your trade entry after the crossing and wait for a pullback to the line and bounce of it then you enter. The retest on the grey line is a much Safer entry</p>
<p>this is the best safest entry</p>
<p>or a good place to load into trade you already have</p>
<p>one has to be patient to be a trader</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/image3.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>use the 4h to find entry, then go to the 1 hr. If that not detailed enough go to the 30 and so forth</p>
<p>but ride the trend on the 1 hr</p>
<p>The bounce pattern takes awhile to get a grasp on.&nbsp; Long entry is usually better midway up, short is usually midway down on 30m or 1 hr timeframe.</p>
<p>Use 4hr to make sure its real bottom or real top.&nbsp; Then i go to the 1 hr or 30 mins to execute trades</p>
<p>That's all I do. Rinse and repeat. Sideways action, i just do other things</p>
<p>the top and bottom is the danger zone, be careful</p>
<p>learn that reversal points are dangerous and real trades happen after</p>
<p>lot of pressure dots which typically can mean be a dump or a pump on progress still.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The trigger line is above the grey and redline</p>
<p>That is entry opportunity</p>
<p>1. Wait for trigger line to cross over the gray and the red</p>
<p>2. Wait for a pullback and the bounce after crossing</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/image4.png"></figure>
<p>---------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>for Range trading:</strong></p>
<p>Doable in the smaller time frame. Draw a channel and enter at the support, Exit at the top</p>
<p>You can see the indicator trigger line is moving within the red and gray wave. That is a sideway action</p>
<p>early entries will punish everyone. Be patient my friends and enter on on confirmation</p>
<p>Resistance line is still bottomed out = testing support</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/image5.png"></figure>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>- Here is a screenshot that shows a very common short entry. Keep an eye for these. The red wave is the support line, when the oscillator passes under it goes back to test the line and gets rejected. This is the start of downtrend. It is also a good exit for a long. Try to enter and exit trades from cross-overs and cross-unders with pressure (red or green dots). When there is a lot of pressure on the bottom (0) or top (10) line and the oscillator drags it means it is breaking the support/resistance line and is likely to pull back and test the line again. Keep an eye for the signs and use longer timeframes to help paint a picture.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/image6.png"></figure>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>in a down trend i set up my long trade</p>
<p>in an up trend i setup my short</p>
<p>i never look at the charts today for a trade today as I don't sculp. I look today to see what's coming my way</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">plan ahead:</mark></p>
<p>you set up the long on the 1 hr while you are doing shorts</p>
<p>and you wait for the break and then enter longs on the fast frames</p>
<p>as is above so is below</p>
<p>in this example 1h setup is for the direction of the trades on lower timeframe</p>
<p>4hr is killer on the fast frames</p>
<p>if you set up a trade on a 4hr chart, the trades on the 5min chart are insane</p>
<p>for back-testing:</p>
<p>use 1 hour</p>
<p>look for the break and then look at 15 and 5 for entries</p>
<p>or just enter off the 1 hr like a boss</p>
<p>you also can do replays of the breaks to learn the behaviour of the test</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">About trading:</mark></p>
<p>it always feels like you are missing out</p>
<p>but it will pause and look like it want to turn</p>
<p>soon as it takes off you are in</p>
<p>its the best entry in my opinion</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">About Exit and reloading strategy:</mark></p>
<p>Most real booms will go straight to the bottom or top then pull back for another push</p>
<p>I either get out at the top and renter at pullback, but if it doesn't look like a straight forward entry, I will just pull some positions at top/bottom then throw them back in at the top/bottom of pullback</p>
<p>if it pushes hard a second time, i prepare for a third push</p>
<p>eventually it will make a bear or bull pattern and break it, depending if it is a short or long.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">advices:</mark></p>
<p>setup trades from the 4h down to 1h</p>
<p>no more than 10x and 10% of your trading account</p>
<p>Don't enter reversals</p>
<p>you need to set your trades up on longer timeframes even if you scalp or you will loose</p>
<p>you are entering when it is not an entry</p>
<p>if you look on the 4 hr or 1hr you will know</p>
<p>if you follow the btc room you will here me say do not enter reversal and everyone just wait</p>
<p>not every movement is worth trading</p>
<p>if you trade every movement you will loose</p>
<p>you need to pick the good ones</p>
<p>and wait</p>
<p>today you set up trades for the next week</p>
<p>next week comes you have trades</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">About Stop losses:</mark></p>
<p>don't use stop losses</p>
<p>its a take loss</p>
<p>think about it, you can just exit if its not good trade</p>
<p>or exit at a good place and in profit</p>
<p>if you enter a risk free trade, then using SL is pointless. put it by your liquidation price</p>
<p>you have to treat your account like it is a big account!</p>
<p>Try put $300k on with a tight stop loss! doesn't it sound reasonable?</p>
<p>until you trade like a pro, you wont be one</p>
<p>I'm not knocking other strategies, but I've done them all and I would rather talk about booms</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong></p>
<p>If I'm trying to get entries from 1h , means that I can setup my trades on 4h to see the breakout and scalp in 1h TF right ?</p>
<h2>Answer:</h2>
<p>No, just look for the patterns,</p>
<p>draw the lines,</p>
<p>set alerts,</p>
<p>and wait</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>when the Oscillator is going up = setting up a short,</p>
<p>when the Oscillator is going down = setting up a long,</p>
<p>wait for the down trend to turn into an up trend and vice versa</p>
<p>or just enter the breaks and you don't need to worry about trend or price</p>
<p>You just catch the ride and hop off</p>
<p>You only need to worry about trend if you try to ride the whole trend,</p>
<p>if you are entering the break, trend is not important</p>
<p>but always use analysis of longer time frames.</p>
<p>the more downward pressure the more green dots there are</p>
<p>the more upward pressure the more red dots there are</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>lot's of people have a hard time about when to take profit.</p>
<p>it is actually simple!&nbsp; Just exiting at the next entry</p>
<p>i depends on the break too.</p>
<p>you should wait for it to pull back and test SR then enter</p>
<p>in case of a long, see the green pressure dots too, they are&nbsp; pushing down into a SR which it bounces off</p>
<p>Even tho I don't personally scalp much, I do recommend it for new traders as a practice</p>
<p>When I scalp I use a stop loss. I drop it at 25% when i enter a limit order</p>
<p>as the bar goes up and breaks lines i move it up in profit</p>
<p>when i want to exit i move it right up to the top of bar and let it hit it</p>
<p>back test some 5 min entries, get a taste</p>
<p>i always keep my stop loss in profit in these trades just in case</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>trading the under 5min and over 1 hr charts are different games but the same</p>
<p>things happen faster in the&nbsp; 5mins and less so you don't have time to make your moves like when trading on a 4hr</p>
<p>so stop losses are much more important because a little move on the 4hr is huge on the 5min</p>
<p>once you start entering the good trades it will be all you want</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>summary by @bgn_3</p>
<p>1. Draw your trendline and when it breaks, it means you are getting ready to enter but do not enter just yet</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Wait till the price-line came down cross under both red and/or gray SR line</p>
<p>3. Then wait for the little curve back on the price-line to test the SR line. You want to see it gets rejected</p>
<p>4. Typically no more pressure dots during your entry. That should be your entry.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p><strong>A few tips for new users:</strong><br>This indicator is extremely fast so you don’t have to be… What this means is you have more time than you think to plan trades and enter trades. Take your time and wait for confirmation. Most times after crossing a support or resistance line, price action will pull back and retest the line/wave before taking off. These make great entries. Volume pressure is constantly collecting data so closer it is to the close of a bar the more information it has and stronger the signal. Green and red arrows are great direction pressure signals.&nbsp;<br><br>Avoid entering long entries when the oscillators are flatlining and dragging along the bottom. Be patient and wait for the bounces to clean up. Look for single sharp spikes from the top and bottom SR lines. Use longer timeframes to track behaviour.<br><br>Keep an eye on bull and bear patterns, this is a very accurate indication of what is around the corner.&nbsp;<br><br>Use Tesla Coil to greatly improve your trading experience. Wait for a crossover on the Tesla coil before entering on Boom hunter. While Tesla coil does not tell you which way it is going to explode, boom hunter does. Make sure you use multiple time frames to analyze what support and resistance is a head. If it looks like a tangled mess that’s because it is a tangled mess and its best to wait for a tesla coil signal to avoid choppy sideways action :)</p>
