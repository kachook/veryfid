<h1>Center Of Gravity Oscillator</h1>
<p>If I could only have one indicator it would need to be versatile. It would need to be able to confirm trends, highlight pivots, and reversals but most of all it would need to expose epic entries. Lucky there is such an indicator and it is called the Center of Gravity Oscillator (CoG).&nbsp;<br><br>The center of gravity is yet another masterpiece created by John Ehlers. It is essentially zero lag and enables clear identification of turning points. This indicator is a result of Ehler's research into adaptive filters and was published in an article on page 20 of the May 2002 issue of Stocks and Commodities Magazine. According to the TradingView docs, "The center of gravity is an indicator based on statistics and the Fibonacci golden ratio". It uses LSMA as a "zero median line."&nbsp;This is a great oscillator for setting up trades and spotting reversals. There many strategies that you can use with it.</p>

<h2>Continuation</h2>
<p><strong>Strategy 1: </strong>Long positions are entered when current low point is higher than previous low. Short positions are entered as current high is lower than previous high.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 2: </strong>The above shows a nice long and short on the major pivots. The first trade is a long. As the major low pivot is made it does not break the previous major pivot low and thus is a great long entry. Price then breaks out and forms a major high pivot point which does not break the previous major pivot high making a great short entry.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Strategy 3:</strong> A major Pivot is made. Long entries are found every time the lows keep getting higher. Often these are LSMA pumps. It is great for swing trading.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 4:</strong> Trading on continuations of trends.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong> This is a lower high and short signal regardless of where it is. The idea is to get confluence between the indicators</p>

<h2>Breakout</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Trend line</li>
  <li>LSMA breakout</li>
  <li>Smaller breakout</li>
  <li>Epic breakout</li>
  <li>Major pivots</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Trend lines and wedges can be made by connecting 2 or more pivot points (as shown above). When the oscillator crosses the trend line traders can expect “boom” like explosions in price action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another example of epic breakouts</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/cogxl/epicbreakout.png">

<p>Below I’ve marked out some breakouts on 1H ETH chart.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/cogxl/epicbreakout2.png">
  <figcaption>Length 11</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Smaller breakouts can be found by drawing a fan from major pivots to minor pivots.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/cogxl/smallerbreakouts.png">
  <figcaption>Length 6</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Epic breakouts can be found by drawing a trend line along <strong>major pivot points</strong>. The major pivots should be easy to spot as they stick out above and below the minor pivots. (As shown below on 1-hour chart.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Least Squares Moving Average is my favourite moving average and I incorporate it in one way or another with most of my scripts.&nbsp;I've marked out the most obvious breakouts on the ETH Daily chart below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To understand an LSMA breakout, have a look at the LSMA 21 line on the chart below. As the candles cross the line it breaks out.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Reversal patern</h2>
<p><strong>Strategy: </strong>If you are not familiar with reversal patterns such as double tops, double bottoms or head and shoulders then it would be a good idea to look into it. These are fundamentals of reading charts. The COG is great for trading these patterns too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Crossover / Crossunder</h2>
<p><strong>Strategy : </strong>If a market is bullish long trades are entered as the COG line crosses over the red LSMA line. Traders have the option of scalping the first crossover or even scaling out of trade to close on the second exit. This works the opposite for shorts when the market is bearish.</p>

<h2>Channels and fibs</h2>
<figure class="image"><img src="/cogxl/fibs.png">

</figure>
<p>Fib channels are very powerful with an example below showcasing it below.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/cogxl/fibchannels.png">

</figure>
<p>Traditional and simple way to draw channels with the “parallel channel” tool listed in TradingView drawing section under “Trend Lines”. Simple borders and middle line, keeps it clean and easy to read.</p>

<h2>Crossover above LSMA / Crossunder below LSMA</h2>
<p>Example of entry</p>

<h2>Multi-length analysis and Multi-time frames</h2>
<p><i>Using multiple lengths is like time frames within time frames</i></p>
<p>Here is a good example of how multiple center of gravity can be use for entries. You have first pullback, the cross of ZLSMA, and higher low (HL) working together for confirmation of the next move of price action.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="/cogxl/picture3.png">

<p><strong>Multiple CoG with two time frames</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example with 5,15,1h and 4h. This story starts with a first pullback on the 5 min and then fractals through the timeframes and lengths.&nbsp;</p>
