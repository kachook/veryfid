<h1>Extra</h1>
<p>Keep in mind parallel channels on the chart are static and boom hunter tracks a dynamic channel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Test2</h2>
<p>Do not trade the moves inside the wedge unless you are planning on it breaking out the other side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>test3</h3>
<p>You really need to learn the fundamentals. There are like 3 rules</p>
<ol>
  <li>No reversals</li>
  <li>Long in an up channel, short in a down channel</li>
  <li>No reversals</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Sever: and if I generalize, reversal is trying to catch the top shorting the up trend and vice versa?</p>
<p>A reversal is trying to short an up trending channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>wait for the channel to break</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>its testing the trend line</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a fakeout.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just stop shorting in up trends and stop longing in down trends, its hard to lose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not about fixed numbers. Price action sets up a trade, it breaks an SR, it pullback to confirm, enter, wait for it to break the next level and then lock it in under the level. Numbers do not come into it. When you enter price action will be bouncing in a wedge or channel, you need to wait for it to break it and move on. If it breaks against you then it is time to look for an exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are riding a trend you should be updating your stop after each pullback/entry</p>

<p>This trend line is perfect and should not move. Now price action has broke the line and is testing it. It is also breaking a long setup. At this point you are looking for price action to either get back on the trend line and continue or for it to break the new short setup and get rejected from channel top</p>

<p>Those that have progressed the most are the ones that have put in the time and effort. Now it is time to step up to the next level. What makes a successful trader? Simple, successful traders have a system and a set of rules. It does not have to be complicated. In fact basic is better. Everyone see’s the charts differently and picks up on different things. To step up to the next level you will need to do some homework. Instead of chart analysis it is imperative that you do trade analysis. This means you need to look at your trades. There are 2 important things to focus on. Firstly, what are your best, most successful trades? You need to understand the setup of these trades and make rules for it in the future. You need to make a system to find these trades, enter these trades and exit these trades. I can’t stress how important this is. Hitting everything that comes your way will not make you successful. Having a working system WILL make you successful. Secondly, you need to look at your most common mistakes. This can be hard sometimes because our ego’s can get in the way but it is a crucial step to make progress. Find your weaknesses and make rules to stop it happening in the future. Look at where you are going wrong, it could be that you are jumping in trades at the wrong time because of FOMO. If you have only made 5 trades in your life, making a system is out of the question. However if you have made hundreds or thousands of trades this should be easy because you have enough data to filter and make a working system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately we have been covering how to setup trades. This is by far the most important part of developing your trading system. When trading there is nothing as crucial as a good entry but to get these entries it is very important that setting alerts becomes part of your system. Once you have identified a setup you need to work out what alerts you need to set to warn you when to look at the chart. It is no good setting up trades and then missing them. Your alerts could be a crossover/crossunder on a faster time frame/length or a cross of a trend line etc. If you are setting up on the 1 hour time frame try and look at the 30 minutes time frame to set alerts, this way you get notified before the 1hr cross. Working out what alerts you need will also help make your setup more solid, it will help you understand your setup better and hopefully make things more clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First find the setups and then find the alerts</strong></p>

<p>After drawing a breakout line on boom hunter use the visibility feature for "current interval only" and your trend lines wont show on other time frames</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When drawing lines on your chart you can use "current interval or below" so when you draw lines on the weekly, daily and 4 hour you will see them when you zoom in but when you draw a line on the 15 minutes you won't see it when you zoom out. This is also great when drawing trend lines on boom hunter, so that when you change time frames it won't show up. You can have one window and adjust your lines and not have worry about it showing up in random areas when you switch to another time frame.</p>
