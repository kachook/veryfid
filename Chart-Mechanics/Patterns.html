<p>How to know where is the major pivot points to start drawing trend line in COG?</p>
<p>if oscillator is going down connect some pivot highs, if oscillator is going up connect some pivot lows.</p>

<p>When setting up a long look for these patterns</p>
<p>in most cases when it breaks these lines it will pull back to test before flying off so you have plenty of time to enter a trade</p>
<p>If you ever need more detail take a peek a shorter timeframe. If you use 1hr then have a look at the 30min. Sometime is will let you know what is coming</p>
<p>Best is to use longer timeframes to find the true bottom</p>
<p>you can watch it bottom out across the timeframes, it will eventually make a pivot away from the bottom support line</p>
<p>the less pressure dots the more likely it will pivot. If there is a lot of pressure dots it is likely to pull back and push the SR line again</p>

<p>Caution entering a long position after is has broken the trend line as it may get rejected so be ready to exit.</p>
<p>ride to top of channel, if lots of pressure it may break the channel and continue upwards</p>
<p>Here is last BTC up trend on 1hr. there were 2 good entries:</p>

<p>trendlines are good on all timeframes</p>

<p>here is an example of it breaking the line. the best entry is the test after it breaks</p>
