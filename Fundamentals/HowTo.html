<h1>Fundamentals (work in progress)</h1>
<p>Channels are the most important fundamental to learn if you want to understand price action. Price action is not even price action. It is just a time series with harmonics, all charts follow these laws. When the weather chart moves we don't call that price action. These are the most basic fundamentals of magnetic energy, electricity, audio, analog signals, and the entire universe and life itself.</p>

<h1>How to draw parallel channels</h1>
<p>Fibonacci are just channels. I spend countless hours trying to crack the chart code and find the formula. I tried all sorts of things. I found it eventually, 1 +1 = 2. Don't complicate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>1+1 = 2. The first step of Fibonacci is a channel doubling.</li>
  <li>1+2 = 3. The second step is the channel halving.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Price action</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important thing a trader can do is learn price action. Without these fundamentals a charts behavior will seem random and unpredictable. Price action has a set of laws that it must follow. To make a move, price action must first set it up. Knowing these rules makes it is possible to setup trades well in advance. Many new traders quickly get stuck into labels like “day trader” or “I only trade futures”. This usually evolves into a strange set of rules such as “I only short futures on the 5 minute timeframe and only after 10am”. These labels and meaningless rules are limitations that only serve to decrease your odds of success. As traders we trade what the charts give us. A big breakout is a big breakout. Time, date and price have nothing to do with it. Some days are just not good to trade. It is pointless risking your account on trades during sideways action. A common misconception is that futures charts are different. All charts are the same, there is no difference between futures, regular contracts or even index charts. No matter what the chart, they all still follow the same rules and make the same patterns. I refer to these actions as “Chart Mechanics”. Every trader goes through the quest of finding the ultimate indicator, I was no exception. The problem is that traders get far too fixated on indicators and miss what is important. Indicators are tools to help read price action. They are interpretations of what is happening on the chart. While every indicator has its strengths and weaknesses the reality is that if you cant read price action, you cant read an indicator. A trader should never rely on someone else’s buy/sell signals and should always know what kind of move they are trading. If you are struggling, I am willing to bet this is why. Every other day I see screenshots of charts with 14+ indicators which include a plethora of things such as auto trend lines, harmonic patterns, Bollinger bands and volume profile. There is so much junk on the chart that it is impossible to even see the candles. Most retail traders have indicators on their charts and don’t even know why they are there or how to use them. With just a few drawing tools you can replace the need for any indicators.<br>Fundamentally, trading is all about buying and selling but what traders fail to realize is that the chart itself actually has very little to do with buying and selling. The filling of order blocks happens behind the scenes and the ticker data we receive is a signal that is processed after the fact. Using techniques such as digital signal processing (DSP) it is possible to perform all kinds of tricks like filter out frequencies and interference, analyze impulse responses and even find cycles that begin 10+ years before ending with a dump. These cycles and frequencies do not give a shit about liquidity, news, politics, volume or any other unimportant rubbish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example of a hidden cycle in the Dow Jones Index. This cycle originated on November 11 1910 and finished with a dump 110 years later</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traders easily get swept up in news events and hype which are designed to lead the public astray. For example many news events are blamed as the cause for big moves on the charts but the reality is that these moves have been getting setup long before they hit your twitter feed. With or without the news these moves were going to happen anyway. News events only happen in three places. A channel top, a channel bottom or a channel median. Below is an example of the SPY index using the economic calendar by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/script/FAShzjTK-EconomicCalendar/">@jdehorty</a>. The vertical bars show FOMC meetings. These meetings are believed to have an influence on the chart however they are always scheduled to be at one of these three place in the channel and always at a move that has already been setup. This pattern is evident in all news events that are said to affect the charts and global economy. I have gone back and checked this for every major event in the last 30 years and its always at a channel top, bottom or median. It is very well documented that news and media was designed and developed by governments to control and manipulate the masses so I am not going to get into the how’s and why’s of this phenomena because its not important. I am only pointing this out so you can understand that the trades and moves on the charts are already setup. If you get your technical analysis from the news it is already too late.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to quickly talk about continuations and entries:</p>
<p>When price action starts pumping it will get into the teal zone of preset 1. To find continuation entries you need to wait for price action to pullback. The best are the breakouts as seen on the right of the screenshot. In a bull trend this breakout pattern will happen 2-3 times on the 1 hr chart. These are the creme entries. Other wise you are looking for price action to break down and then break up as seen on the left of the screen.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation pullback.png"></figure>
<p>this is a text book continuation double bottom which is also a batman (4hr)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation3.png">
  <figcaption>Always look for the breakouts</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When price action is coming back up the oscillator you will get several chances at pullbacks. The first safe entry is after it pulls back above the pump zone. The second entry is the crossover of the second oscillator. The next pullback to look for is above the median and lastly you are looking at first pb after it gets into the up trending/pump zone.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation4.png"></figure>
<p>The first entry above the pump zone can still turn out to be a pullback for a short so keep that in mind. Look out for first pullback for preset 3 when it hits the roof. if price action breaks the channel these are excellent places to be.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation5.png"></figure>
<p>what you want to see is price action break down and then break back over (preferably above the median)</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation6.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep an eye for active trend lines (channels). You can find great entries when price action pulls back onto them.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation7.png"></figure>
<p>Price action can also break under the trend line and batman itself back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always look for price action to come back down to enter a long. Look for the pullback to hold above the up trending zones and above its trend line.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation8.png"></figure>
<p>please make sure you back test this and train yourselves what to look for. Check out 1hr and 4hr charts. This works in both directions so look at short continuations too</p>
<p>Here is an example for short continuations</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation9.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation10.png">
  <figcaption>Breakouts</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In an up trending channel you are looking for breakouts to continue up.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/continuation11.png"></figure>
<p>To turn around from a down trending channel to an up trending channel price action will need to first create the next channel.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/movement.png"></figure>
<p>To do this price action will need to do 2 things. First it will need to open its range. In this example we can see a tight consolidation period. Price action will need to open this up.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/movement2.png"></figure>
<p>A break from this consolidation period will break its channel and cause a pump (or dump if its to the downside). This move will open up price action but in order to make a new up trending channel it will need to pullback and stamp down a pivot. These are key moments traders should be looking for as these are the mother of all first pullbacks.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/movement3.png"></figure>
<p>To make an up trending channel we need 3 points. This is why price action always comes back. It needs to stamp down the channels.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/fundamentals/channel created.png"></figure>
<p>The first big pivot will determine the next trend. A pump or dump happens when this channel breaks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cant tell you exactly why charts follow these laws, all I have are theories. Really "why" and "how" does not matter anyway. Knowing won't change a breakout or first pullback.</p>
<p>For any new traders here, what I am trying to say is that the trading world is rigged against the retailer. It is designed to flush out your money. All these fancy contracts like options and high leverage are products made to decrease your odds. As traders we need to do everything to increase our odds, this is why betting with the trend is so important. <strong>Entering reversals can be very lucrative but it is also <u>high risk</u> and if you don't do it correctly you <u>WILL</u> get rekt and lose.</strong></p>
