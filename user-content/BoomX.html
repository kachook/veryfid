<h1>Boom Hunter X</h1>
<p>Introducing the next generation of Boom Hunter. All presets have been optimized and now are faster and more accurate. Zones and dynamic support and resistance bands have been added to preset 2 to help target entries and ride trends.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Preset 1 is a brand new Boom Hunter oscillator that is high definition and ultra fast. It is so fast that the default length of 9 is faster than the original Boom Hunter XL oscillator at length 1. Preset 1 has the sole purpose of assisting entries. This configuration should only be used once you know what trade you are looking for. There is no need to look at it all the time which makes it ideal to live as a widget on the side of your indicator. Using this oscillator is the equivalent of looking at a faster time frame and will help target accurate higher lows and lower highs. The smoothing used in this preset is based on a 3,6,9 concept by Nikola Tesla.</li>
  <li>Preset 2 is the most versatile option and default for X. It is built on the Boom Hunter XL flat smoothing oscillator. Flat smoothing is the most neutral type of smoothing available for Boom Hunter. It is the perfect for finding tops and bottoms as well as setting up breakouts. This preset shows price action break through several key levels which gives several opportunities to find first pullbacks.</li>
  <li>Preset 3 has the job of identifying trend and market conditions. It is the best oscillator for setting up big moves. This has the heaviest smoothing and uses the golden ratio to control the curve. All smoothing in BHX is done with an original and unique method within the oscillators formula which gives the benefits of smoothing but maintains its accuracy and reacts instantaneously with zero lag.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Signals for pivots include:</strong><br>Gray Triangle: Pivot (Any pivot that is not listed below)<br>Yellow Triangle: First Pullback (change from LH to HL or HL to LH)<br>Teal triangle: Higher Low (HL)<br>Red Triangle: Lower High (LH)<br>Orange Triangle: Reversal (HH or LL near the top or bottom of the channel)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the recommended layout. Use all three Presets to get the best results and setups.</p>

<h2>Preset 1</h2>
<p>Preset 1 is a brand new Boom Hunter oscillator that is high definition and ultra fast. It is so fast that the default length of 9 is faster than the original Boom Hunter XL oscillator at length 1. Preset 1 has the sole purpose of assisting entries. This configuration should only be used once you know what trade you are looking for. There is no need to look at it all the time, which makes it ideal to use as a widget on the side of your indicator. Using this oscillator is the equivalent of looking at a faster time frame and will help target accurate higher lows (HL) and lower highs (LH).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset1_plain.png"></figure>
<p>Preset 1 should only be used for targeting entries. Use Preset 2 and Preset 3 to setup trades like breakouts and first pullbacks. When you are ready to enter use Preset 1 to assist.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Preset 2</h2>
<p>Preset 2 is best for setting up breakouts for your trades in advance.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset2_setupbr.png"></figure>
<p>When Preset 3 enters the Teal up trending (above median line 5) and pump zones (Level 7 to 10). Setup breakout with your trend lines and wait for price action to come back (wait for the pullback) with Preset 2.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset2_breakout_2.png"></figure>
<p>Avoid attempting long positions when it is in the down trend (below median line 5) or dump zones (Level 3 to 0).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset2_1.png"></figure>
<p>When price action is coming back from the dump zone look for another breakout to continue the trend. You can use the OSC2 breakout to enter as a simple strategy.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset2_continuation.png"></figure>
<p>This is the dump zone (level 3 to 0), with the (level 1 to 0) being stronger and breaking the channel. Price action is pushing channel support and making a bottom.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/picture126.png"></figure>
<p>When price action starts pumping it will get into the teal zone of preset 1. To find continuation entries you need to wait for price action to pullback. The best are the breakouts as seen on the right of the screenshot. In a bull trend this breakout pattern will happen two to three times on the 1 hour chart. These are the creme entries. Other wise you are looking for price action to break down and then break up as seen on the left of the screen</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset2_breakout1.png"></figure>
<p>Text book continuation double bottom.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset2blk.png"></figure>
<p>Always look for the breakouts.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset2_breakout_and_double_bottom.png"></figure>
<p>What you want to see is price action break down and then break back over <u>(preferably above the median).</u></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset_23.png"></figure>
<p>Always look for price action to come back down to enter a long. Look for the pullback to hold above the up trending zones and above its trend line</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:94.67%;"><img src="/boomx/preset_24.png"></figure>
<p>When price action is coming back up the oscillator you will get several chances at pullbacks. The first safe entry is after it pulls back above the dump zone. The second entry is the crossover of the second oscillator. The next pullback to look for is above the median and lastly you are looking at first pullback after it gets into the up trending/pump zone.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset_42.png">
  <figcaption>The first entry above the pump zone (level 7 to level 10) can still turn out to be a pullback for a short so keep that in mind</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Preset 3</h2>
<p>Preset 3 is best for trend and big pivots</p>
<p>When in the teal and red the market is trending up or down</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset3_plain.png"></figure>
<p>Between 3 and 7 market is choppy/sideways (in the median band highlighted below) and above 9 it is pumping below 1 it is dumping.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset3_sideways.png"></figure>
<p>Look for how price action breaks, watch for a HL in the teal on Preset 3.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:81.46%;"><img src="/boomx/preset3_uptrending2.png"></figure>
<p>Look out for first pullback for preset 3 when it hits the roof of the channel (level 10). If price action breaks the channel these are excellent places to enter a trade from.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset_3_pb.png"></figure>
<p>When price action is pushing down with preset 3 look for price action to pullback up and break back down.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:69.04%;"><img src="/boomx/preset_28.png"></figure>
<h2>Examples, Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p><u>The key points are:</u> Do not counter trade (reversal) from top or bottom of indicators. Let it come down first and make a pullback or break some SR Look for continuation pullbacks (double tops and bottoms) and continuation breakouts. Moves that continue a trend are the best entries.</p>
<p>Don't counter trade tops and bottoms, let it turn around first then join in.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset2_countertrade.png"></figure>
<p>Here is an example for short continuations</p>

<p>When price action is pushing up look for the pullback</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset_29.png">
  <figcaption>Entering when OSC1 crosses OSC2, is basically like a pivot from a higher time frame.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is just how price action works, it takes time to get used to it. These continuation pullbacks <strong><u>are the best entries on the charts</u>.</strong></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset_30png.png"></figure>
<p>Red shows down pressure. When the oscillator is flat at the top it shows pressure against the channel top (level 10). Here we can see price action break its channel. When it turns red it shows down pressure. This shows price action pulling back down hard above the channel.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset_40.png"></figure>
<p>Price needs to push down to move up, here we can see price action pulling back hard</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/preset_41.png"></figure>
<p>Drawing breakout lines on your chart and indicator will help you find the moves</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/picture121.png"></figure>
<p>Tracking trend lines and the channels is important to find the big moves</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/picture122.png"></figure>
<p>These are continuation entries</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/picture123.png"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/picture124.png"></figure>
<p>When OSC2 turns yellow it shows a price action going through a consolidation period (sideways action) on a faster time frame.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/boomx/picture125.png"></figure>
<p>When OSC1 is above OSC2 and in the teal, price action is moving up (uptrend). When it is above level 7 there is a strong trend. When OSC1 is below OSC2 and red price action is moving down (downtrend). When it is below level 3 it is in a strong down trend.</p>
