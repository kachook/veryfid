<p>Boom hunting is all about setting up your trades well in advance and letting them come to you. My focus in this wiki will be on catching the big movements but Boom Hunter XL will work great with any strategy. Below you will find some examples of the most common entries and strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Breakout Entries</h1>
<p>Breakout entries are probably my most preferred setup. Big booms always come from a breakout. Using this indicator you will be able to find many types of breakouts but the best ones are the breaks that change a trend. To setup a breakout we need to draw a break/trend line on Boom Hunter XL. In the screenshot below we can see the first line travelling at a downwards angle, this is a long setup. This break line was drawn by connecting the high pivots.The second trend line connects the pivot lows as it is travelling upwards, this is a short setup.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:42.76%;"><img src="/bo1.png">
  <figcaption>&nbsp;If the oscillator is travelling down, connect some pivot highs. If the oscillator is traveling up, connect some pivot lows.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In most cases, when price action breaks these lines it will pull back to test before flying off. So you have plenty of time to enter a trade. If you ever need more details, take a peek at a faster timeframe. If you use 1hr then have a look at the 30m. If that's not good enough, try the 15m, etc. Sometimes, it will let you know what is coming and help expose the entry better.</p>
<p>Caution entering positions as it is breaking a trend line because it will want to pull back. The first pullback is usually the best entry for a breakout. Always wait for confirmation before entering as it can still get rejected. Be patient and catch it as it takes off. Below is an example of a typical set of longs within a boom.</p>

  <figcaption>Caution entering a long after it has broke the trend line as it may get rejected. So, be ready to exit.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It helps to draw trend lines on your chart when catching a boom. Trend lines are great and work on all timeframes. After price action has broke a trend line, it will want to come back to test the line before continuing.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Chart Pattern Entries</h1>
<p>Chart patterns work great on the Boom Hunter XL oscillator. e.g. double top/bottom patterns, triangles, wedges, flags, trend lines, ascending/descending channels, head and shoulders, etc... Boom Hunter XL will expose patterns that are normally hard to pickup by just looking at the chart alone.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Support and Resistance Bounce Entries</h1>
<p>I love to enter a trade as price action bounces off a support or resistance line. These trades often go straight into profit and stay that way. To catch a bounce, wait for the oscillator to cross a red support and resistance band. In most cases, it will pull back to test the line before taking off. Enter the trade as it fly away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some examples of short entries.&nbsp;</p>

        </td>
        <td>Note the single pressure dot on the long entry. 1 - 3 pressure dots make an excellent bounce from a SR band. Remember to wait for the pressure dots to stop before entering your trade.</td>
      </tr>

<h1>Continuation Entries</h1>
<p>Trading continuations is great because you are betting with the trend. One of the easiest ways to find a continuation entry is to use the red SR band. If the band makes a low pivot then a higher low pivot, it signals there is a continuation in uptrend. Likewise, if the red SR band makes a high pivot then a lower high pivot, it signals a continuation of downtrend.</p>

<p>Here is a strategy on the 15m timeframe with COG set on default.&nbsp;You can use any timeframe and COG length. The slower the timeframe and length, the stronger the signals.&nbsp;<br>Enter a long when the pivot low is higher than the previous and enter shorts when pivot high is lower than previous</p>

<h1>Reversal Entries</h1>
<p>Reversal trading is betting against the trend. Trading reversals is very dangerous as a pivot can easily turn into a pump or a dump. One of my rules is to never trade reversals, this is one of the many reasons why I am not a fan of swing trading. I will wait for a pivot/reversal to complete then enter the first pullback on confirmation. I see too many new traders spunk all their money in a reversal period and have nothing left to trade with when the waves get good.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reversal periods are hard to read because there is so much pressure going in both directions. You will get mixed signals. Once the reversal is complete, the entries will be easy and all the indicators will be more accurate.</li>
  <li>Don't enter reversals. Reversals are for new traders and amateurs.</li>
  <li>Have patience and DO NOT enter reversals, just wait! They are rough waters. Not every movement in the market is worth trading. If you try to trade every movement, you will lose more money than you make.</li>
  <li>If you are foolish enough to enter a reversal, make sure you use low leverage and bet an amount you are comfortable losing. If the trade goes the way you wanted it to go, you can load in more positions as it takes off.</li>
  <li>Always wait for the reversal to finish making a top or bottom then enter the next pullback when it confirms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below we can see an example of why it's better to enter the first pullback.</p>

<h1>Swing Trading</h1>
<p>Swing trading is based on trading reversals. Most traders will use this kind of strategy on faster timeframes like the 5m or 15m charts. I've tried every strategy and this is the worst. To be successful at trading, it is imperative that you use multiple timeframes. Only looking at one timeframe means you have no idea of the bigger picture. It means you will enter every movement. So, you will often enter into sideways action or get punished with bad trades.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sideways action is for 5m swing traders, not for boom hunters.</li>
  <li>Trading faster timeframes and slower timeframes are different games, but the same. Things happen faster in the 5m timeframe, so you don't have time to make your moves like when trading on a 4h timeframe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the channel's support and resistance lines (top and bottom lines) we can pick up pivots and reversals within the current price channel. Be careful when the top line bottoms out for too long, it means that channel support is breaking and it will likely try to push down again.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:43.08%;"><img src="/swing1.png">

<h1>Scalping</h1>
<p>There are many ways to scalp trades, one of my favorites is to catch price action as it breaks through the channel's support and resistance lines. Like it's shown in the screenshot blow.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:43.23%;"><img src="/scalp1.png"></figure>
<p>Another way is to use the pressure dots. The more dots the more pressure. These scalps are movements from slow timeframes that you can catch on faster timeframes.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:43.08%;"><img src="/scalp2.png"></figure>
<p>You can use the COG mode to help enter these scalp style trades. Red means up pressure and green means down pressure. If it crosses over with up pressure (red) you can enter a long and exit next cross under. If it crosses under with green pressure enter short and exit next crossover. This is scalping the pumps and dumps so be "in and out"</p>

<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:43.02%;"><img src="/entries/entry1.1.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Use a stop loss when Scalping.</li>
  <li>Never put in more than 1% of your account in a scalp trade.</li>
  <li>As the bar goes up and breaks SR lines, move your Stop Loss up in profit</li>
  <li>If you want to exit the scalp, you can just move the Stop Loss to the top of bar and let it hit it.</li>
  <li>When scalping, always keep your Stop Loss in profit, just in case</li>
</ul>
<h1>Setting Up An Entry</h1>
<p>To be a successful trader, in my opinion, it is essential you use multiple timeframes (MTF) to do your analysis and prepare your entries.</p>
<p>When setting up a boom, it is important that you read the indicator through different timeframes to create a bias. This means you need to wait for the slower timeframes like the Monthly, Weekly and Daily timeframes to line up and be in your favor. Make sure these timeframes are not making pivots. When these longer timeframes have aligned, look to setup trades using the 1h, 4h and Daily charts. Once these trades have been setup, you can hit them hard on the faster timeframes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don't just get stuck on the 1h, 4h and D charts, scroll through the timeframes, look from top to bottom until you find the setup you are looking for.</li>
  <li>Check out 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, 16h, and 1D timeframes.</li>
  <li>When it crosses under or over any SR lines on slower timeframes, look for entries on fast timeframes to catch these big movements.</li>
  <li>Entering from a faster time frame can get you a better entry. But you also run the risk of entering too early if you don't analyze the slower timeframe correctly.</li>
  <li>If you plan ahead, you will never miss a trade and it is hard to make a wrong decision. Stay open to all options and only enter on confirmation.</li>
  <li>Use trend lines, break lines, and channels.</li>
  <li>Movements on the 4h chart are epic on the fast frames. If you set up a trade on a 4h chart, the trades on the 5m chart will be great.</li>
  <li>Always draw the next setup (using a trend line). Set alerts for the trigger to cross the trend line. It will give you time to open/close a trade and plan the next break</li>
  <li>Look at all the timeframes and find the active ones that paint the best picture.</li>
  <li>Try to line up all the timeframes so they tell the same story then find an entry on a faster timeframe (long or short). However, It is not easy to get all the timeframes aligned and this is why I do not make many trades. I choose quality over quantity.</li>
  <li>Not all the timeframes have to go in same direction. They just have to give the same message. For example, if the monthly and weekly are heading upwards and the daily just crossed a Red SR and the 4hr just finished a pullback.</li>
  <li>When entering a trade, you must have no doubts.</li>
  <li>Don't look for trades today, set up trades for the next week and let them come to you.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Long or Short?</h1>
<p>When setting up a trade, look for the strong entries. You can do this by determining what kind of channel the price is travelling through. There are only 3 options. Always bet with the trend.</p>
