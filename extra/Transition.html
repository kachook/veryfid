<h1>Update (quick guide)</h1>
<p>First stage of the complete overhaul of the XL indicators. Boom Hunter XL has been stripped back to make room for new features. You will find things are missing like volume switch, backtesting mode and confirmation color change on priceline. The price line now turns yellow when pushing the channel. Pressure dots are hidden by default, so is OSC2 (Red SR) and OSC4 (Channel Support and Resistance Lines). Lines now have tick boxes next the them in the settings. This allows you to easily turn lines on and off, turning off oscillator 1 will remove everything like back testing mode. Labels in the style settings have been fixed and improved to make it much easier to navigate the menu. New levels have been added that will be needed in upcoming strategies. The focus is to make this indicator as easy to read and use as possible. For now first pullbacks and pump and dump signals are displayed on the indicator. A SR line is draw when there is a pump and dump signal to help you ride the trade. These features will be greatly improved over the next updates.ance. Look for first pullback entries after testing the channel.</p>

<h1>New features</h1>
<h2>SR Strength (Support and Resistance)</h2>
<p>The SR bands show the support and resistance bands for the current channel. We can visually see price action testing these channels. To trade within the channel look for the first pullback after price action gets rejected. You can adjust these bands to your chart in the settings, either add smoothing or change the sensitivity. Using a sensitivity of 20 will show more ups and downs while increasing this number will show stronger moves/trends. snapshot.</p>
<p>As the strength of support and resistance increases bars will start to appear and get stronger with the SR. When the SR strength peaks candles appear. This shows price action testing SR. After the peak comes the release, Price action will either break the SR or get rejected but at this moment price action is free to move. In the screenshot below we can see how to track price action within the channel. Price action will get pulled to a support or resistance band and then bounce from it. The Candles show the squeeze and release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reminders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They only turn on when getting tested</li>
  <li>It is the channel support and resistance</li>
  <li>It shows the strength of the support band increasing, if it has not broke support it will boom in the direction of resistance</li>
  <li>When price action breaks the channel support and resistance it will to confirm</li>
  <li>Breaking channel SR is when it pumps and dumps</li>
  <li>Using another Boomhunter with Goldenratio (trigger3) on slower timeframes will show you the strongest trends.</li>
  <li>The SR strength peak shows the strongest point of SR when testing. <u>After the pressure is the release. Price action can either break the SR or get rejected, either way it is a big move</u></li>
</ul>

<h2>Smoothing options</h2>
<p>Added smoothing options. Choose between Default, Fibonacci, Pi, Flat and Golden Ratio options. Golden Ratio gives the heaviest smoothing and is great for trends. A thin red line now plots over OSC1 when price action is testing the channels support and resistance. Look for first pullback entries after testing the channel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Volatility</h2>
<p>The volatility signals use Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to push boom hunter in ways it should not be. To make a move the charts need to set it up. Using DSP we can pickup these big moves before it happens. You can either enter on the current pivot, wait for the next pivot, or wait until the end of the trend. This depends on your settings and time frame. There are 3 different frequencies you can adjust including thresholds. Alerts for these signals are coming on next update as well as some new signals and strategies (including entry and exit alerts). You will be able to use these for bot control.</p>
