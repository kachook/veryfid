<p>insteadPrice action moves through parallel channel at all time. So tracking it can help plan trades well in advance.</p>
<p>Price will bounce in channel till it breaks a support or a resistance line; these are the top and bottom line on boom hunter indicator.</p>
<p>When it breaks through, price will bounce through next layer and head in the same direction... every time!</p>
<p>It keeps doing this until it makes a wedge or breakout pattern.</p>
<p>When it breakout, it makes new channel in new direction</p>

<p>There are only 2 possibilities on BTC daily</p>

<p>parallel channels keep getting halves with channels with in them. there are infinite SR lines on a chart. This screenshot I kept halving the channels. see how price bounces through the channels.</p>
<p>Every chart is just channels within channels</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/channels/channels.4.png"></figure>
<p>most times it need a pivot away from the SR line</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/channels/channels.5.png"></figure>
<p>Bull channels will eventually break in upward direction. and Bear channels will eventually break in downward direction.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/channels/channels.6.png"></figure>
<p>These same patterns are on the indicator too</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/channels/channels.7.png"></figure>
<p>Try to identify what channel it is in. There are only 3 options and focus only on the strong trades.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/channels/channels.8.png"></figure>
<p>avoid entering longs whiles it is still changing direction. Safest bet is to wait for it to clean up and confirm change of direction</p>

<p>A really good way to know what is going on is to look at the chart patterns on boom hunter. Right now is is in a bearish pattern on 1hr which means once it exhausts itself it will break this channel and pull right back. I also marked out trend lines in yellow. these are bear signs and when they break usually make a great short</p>

<p>in this shot boom hunter is tracking this parallel channel</p>

<p>Tracking the current channel means you already know the options</p>
<p>this is the blueprint of how price action can travel</p>
