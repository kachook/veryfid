<h1>Channel Mechanics</h1>
<p>Price action moves through a parallel channel at all times, and by tracking it, it is possible to plan trades well in advance. Price will bounce in the channel until it breaks a support or a resistance line; these are the top and bottom lines on the Boom Hunter XL indicator, respectively.</p>
<p>When the price breaks through resistance, the price will bounce through the next layer and head in the same direction every time! It keeps doing this until it makes a wedge, breakout, or reversal pattern, and it forms a new channel in a new direction when it breaks out.</p>
<p>A price channel is just a large SR line/band and follows the same rules:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/sr1.png">
  <figcaption>Schematic of Support and Resistance line/band</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Price action follows natural law and thus can be characterized by a set of rules.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Price action must flow through a channel.</li>
  <li>Channels can be either halved or doubled.</li>
</ul>
<p>The waveforms of the chart MUST move within a channel. There are infinite parallel lines within one parallel channel and, in turn, infinite channels outside of that channel -- "As above, so below."</p>
<p>Interestingly, the doubling/halving process of channels is not particularly unique. Exponential growth and decay are ubiquitous in the natural world, and the same doubling/halving process observed in charts is the same process that serves as the foundation of life itself. In the Middle Ages, this phenomenon was characterized by the famous mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci and became known as "Fibonacci's sequence."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fibonacci's sequence makes a guest appearance anywhere in the universe where exponential growth and decay are relevant: galaxies, nautilus shells, hurricanes, flower petals, and -- you guessed it -- markets. There is not a Fibonacci line on the chart because that's where all the volume is; there is volume because that's where a Fibonacci line is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without going into too much detail, part of why the Fibonacci relationship is relevant in markets is the nature of the travel of polarity. The first doubling creates the first step in creating a vortex within what can be conceptualized as a sub-magnetic rail system. If you plot the Fibonacci sequence on a four-axis chart in every possible way (12 dimensions), you will be left with a very messy chart with lines going in all directions. Out of these lines, there are darker areas where the lines cross over more often. If you look at these darkened areas, it is a picture of a perfect 3-dimensional vortex. Inside this vortex, you will find all the golden ratio patterns as well as a Merkabah in the center and many other shapes you will recognize but thought nothing of before. The Fibonacci lines are hotspots of connectivity and are neutral zones for poles to connect and join this vortex to create an even larger one.</p>

<p>When price action breaks a channel it will flip polarity and head in the same direction.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/c1.png"></figure>
<p>Price action will continue its trend until it sets up a reversal and changes the trend.</p>

<p>Below, we can see there are only 2 possibilities on the BTC daily chart:</p>

<p>Parallel channels keep getting halved with channels inside them. There are infinite SR lines on a chart. In the screenshot below, channels are continuously halved. Observe how the price bounces through the channels.</p>
<p>Every chart consists of channels within channelsâ€¦</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/sr5.png"></figure>
<p>In most cases, to break a channel it needs to pivot away from the SR line.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/sr6.png">
  <figcaption>Example of pivot away from the channel bottom</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bull channels will eventually break in an upward direction and Bear channels will eventually break in a downward direction. An uptrend is a short setup and a downtrend is a long setup.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/sr7.png"></figure>
<p>These patterns are found on the indicator too:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/sr8.png"></figure>
<p>Try to identify what channel it is in. There are only 3 options and focus only on the strong trades.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/chnnelid.png"></figure>
<p>Avoid entering longs while it's still changing direction. Safest bet is to wait for it to clean up and confirm the change of direction</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/sr9.png"></figure>
<p>An excellent way to know what is going on is to look at the chart patterns on boom hunter. Right now it is in a bearish pattern on 1hr. This means once it exhausts itself, it will break this channel and pull right back. I also marked out trend lines in yellow. These are bear signs and when they break usually make a great short.</p>

<p>Tracking the current channel means you already know the options. Below is the blueprint of how price action can travel.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/sr12.png"></figure>
<h1>Red Support and Resistance Band</h1>
<p>The red line is more dynamic and plays a massive part in the price action's direction and behavior. Price action bounces off it to change trajectories and to make a movement. The price action will either slingshot from a red line, bounce off, or launch straight through it. Remember that a cross over or under any SR bands with pressure dots is a strong signal.</p>
<p>- <strong>The Red band/line is a dynamic SR (shows the general trend's direction and behavior)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The price action will either bounce off it to change directions and make a movement, slingshot off from it, bounce off it, or launch straight through it.</li>
  <li>If the oscillator is above the red band/line, it is an uptrend, and if it is below, it's a downtrend.</li>
  <li>Expanding the red SR gives a wider SR band (see settings). It helps filter out sideways action as it makes it very clear, and it also indicates the strength of the SR. The wider it is, the more potent it becomes.</li>
  <li>You can tell the price will drop when the pivot high of the red SR line, itself, is lower than the last Red SR line pivot high.</li>
  <li>You can tell the price will pump when the pivot low of the red SR line, itself, is higher than the last Red SR line pivot low.</li>
  <li>When in doubt, use the last two pivots.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Gray Support and Resistance Band</h1>
<p>The price action moves with the gray line like it's spinning around it. Price action can never get too far away from it. It is sort of like a cable for electricity to run on.</p>
<p><strong>The Gray band/line is a more robust, less dynamic SR.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The gray band shows medium-term support/resistance and general trend.</li>
  <li>It's an uptrend when the white line (the Oscillator) is above the grayline. And when it gets pushed under it, it's a downtrend.</li>
  <li>The price action can never get too far away from the Gray band. This band is much harder to cross as it works like a magnet.</li>
  <li>Price action can quickly bounce within the Gray band or get rejected.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Channel Support and Resistance&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Channel SR is a support and resistance oscillator that tracks price action as it moves through SR lines (support and resistance). It also measures chart pressure as in how hard the price action is pushing against a line or how hard it is moving from it. Price action is constantly trying to break SR lines and will keep bouncing between them until it builds up enough pressure to break through them. The best trades are entries when it bounces off a line. When price action pushes too hard, it will break the line, then pull back and push again (in most cases).</p>
<p>Boom Hunter XL tracks the price's movement through a parallel channel. The bottom line is the support line (teal color), and the top line is the resistance line (red).&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the support line is hitting the roof, it tells you that the price action is testing the current channel's resistance. When price actions break through resistance, it can go for a fly.</li>
  <li>When the top line is hitting the ground, that tells you that price is testing the support of the current channel. This testing effectively signals that it has broken through the support line and can go for a dump.</li>
  <li>The channel support or resistance line will often spike with just a little pressure, thus making for a good pivot.</li>
  <li>If the line flatlines for too long, it breaks the channel and becomes a pump/dump. In this case, it will pull back and test the line before pumping/dumping again. Do NOT enter any trades here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we can see Boom Hunter XL tracking price through a parallel channel.</p>

<p>Below we can see how Boom Hunter XL adapts as price channels change directions and sizes.</p>

<h1>Pressure Analysis</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The pressure dots show when the price action is testing a support or resistance line. Only the areas that are pushing hard on an SR get the dots.</li>
  <li>The fewer pressure dots the more likely it will pivot and the price action will bounce away.</li>
  <li>1 pressure dot signals that it has hit a line and is bouncing from it. It is a strong signal. 1-3 dots makes a great pivot bounce from the SR. If it pushes too long, it breaks the SR.</li>
  <li>The more pressure dots the more likely it will pull back and push the SR line again or it may break the channel and continue upwards/downward. You can scalp these pumps and dumps, but the best entries come from getting in as it bounces from a red SR.</li>
  <li>The more downward pressure the more green dots there are (green dots = downward pressure).</li>
  <li>The more upward pressure the more red dots there are (red dots - upward pressure).</li>
  <li>For entry, wait for the pressure to stop and the reversal to confirm.</li>
  <li>If the Boom Hunter XL Oscillator starts dragging on the top or bottom it will try to push again.</li>
  <li>When the oscillator comes down on an easy slope with pressure, it is likely it pushes again.</li>
  <li>Wait for the pressure to stop before entering trades and catch the first pullback after.</li>
  <li>Never enter any trades until the pressure dots stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line hitting the roof tells you that price is testing the resistance of the current channel it is in. With just a little pressure it will make a pivot but with too much pressure, it will break it and become a pump. It will pull back and test the line before pumping again. These are not places you want to enter any trade.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/supports_resistances/sr.7.png"></figure>
<p>See how in that last screenshot the price pushes down and breaks the support. It then pushes down again. This is common and important to understand. Look for this behavior when analyzing pressure.</p>
<p>Just remember, if the oscillator starts dragging on the top or bottom it will try to push again</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/supports_resistances/sr.8.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the screenshots below, you can tell the price is going to drop when the pivot high is lower than the last pivot high.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/supports_resistances/sr.3.png"></figure>
<p>The same for longs.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/supports_resistances/sr.4.png"></figure>
<p>If in doubt just use the last 2 pivots.</p>
