<p>You should never go short after first bull run. once price action breaks the resistance it usually pulls back and tests again before flying off or getting rejected. either pull out at top and get back in as it flies or pull out some positions at the top and load them back in at the bottom as it breaks</p>
<p>never enter a trade as it is breaking a SR line, wait for it to break it then pull back and test. Once it tests it will either get rejected or fly off. Enter as it flies off.</p>
<p>When it breaks a channel the 2 most likely scenarios is that it will test the line and fly off or it will pull right back test the line and get rejected.</p>

<p>because it is such a steep wave it can come back down just as steep</p>
