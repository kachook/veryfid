<p>Welcome to the offical Boom Hunter XL wiki page. This page was created with the generous support of Boom Hunter XL users. Here you will find information on my indicators and the art of boom hunting. I will keep updating and improving this wiki as I find the time to do so.</p>
<h1>What is a Boom?</h1>
<p>A boom is an explosive movement on the charts. All the tallest candles on a daily chart are booms. Technically these are breakouts but having said that every movement on every time frame is technically a breakout. What makes a boom unique is the setup before it. Waveforms can get a clean pullback allowing them to explode with a fury. As a trader I am only interested in catching the big waves and every other movement is just a piece of the setup required to make a boom. Using my indicators, it is possible to setup up trades well before they happen (even years in advance) and enter at the exact moment it explodes, this avoids entering trades into sideways action. To catch booms you will need to understand chart mechanics and how to read a chart. It is essential that you comprehend the principles of support and resistance. If you are a new trader or from r/wallstreetbets there is a lot of things you need to learn before you can locate and enter these trades successfully.&nbsp;</p>
