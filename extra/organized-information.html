<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">How to use Boom Hunter XL:</mark></h1>
<p>1. Read the indicator through different timeframes to create a bias.</p>
<p>Scroll through the Higher time frames, top to bottom approach until you find a signal that shows the setups you are looking for the best.</p>
<p>Check out 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 1D.</p>
<p>When it crosses under or over any SR on few of these Higher timeframes, look for the same bias action on faster time frame.</p>
<p>Setup a trade on the Higher timeframes chart means you can enter from the faster timeframes &nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering from a faster time frame can get you a better entry. But you also run the risk of entering too early if you don't analyze the longer time frame correctly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Use trend lines, break lines, and channels</p>
<p>&nbsp; all the lines in the indicator are important, they all have a job and work together</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Start preparing for your trade entry after the crossing any SR or trend lines and wait for a pullback to the line and bounce of it then you enter. (The retest on the grey line is a much Safer entry). it is also a good place to load into trade if you are already in one.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Try to enter and exit trades from cross-overs and cross-unders with pressure (red or green dots). When there is a lot of pressure on the bottom (0) or top (10) line and the oscillator drags it means it is breaking the support/resistance line of the channel and is likely to pull back and test the line again. Keep an eye for the signs and use longer timeframes to help paint a picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp; In case of a long, see the green pressure dots too, they are &nbsp;pushing down into a SR which it bounces off</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Take Profit at the next entry. Wait for it to pull back and test SR then exit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">Definitions:</mark></h1>
<p>- Correction, retracement and pullback are three names for the SAME THING</p>
<p>- Retracements are temporary price reversals that take place within a larger trend.</p>
<p>- A reversal is when the trend changes direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Reversals are often characterized by patterns that are contrary such as double tops/bottoms, H&amp;S...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; a pivot is a reversal, it is a change of direction. Look for pivots on the slower charts.</p>
<p>- a dip is a pullback. it is a long setup. buy as it breaks the setup (after retesting)</p>
<p>- a pump is a breakout. it is a short setup. Short as it breaks the setup (after retesting)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">Tips on how to use Boom Hunter XL:</mark></h1>
<p>- Keep in mind that every long and short signal on boom hunter pro is based on a double bounce</p>
<p>- We are looking to catch trades as they bounces of the red band (most of the time). the more dots = more pull back after the bounce.</p>
<p>- You can trade every line on this indicator individually. Every line is a strategy</p>
<p>- draw patters and channels on the chart and have bias from the top down through multiple timeframes then use the Boom Hunter XL to validate and read the chart better and mark entries and exits.</p>
<p>- keep an eye one the previous high/low pivots (link in the COG indicator). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Enter trades when it does not break the previous low (long), high (short). Long entries are found every time the the lows keep getting higher. and the opposite is correct (1h is best)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Use the pivots of the indicator to draw &nbsp;support and resistance lines on the indicator itself and also on the the chart .</p>
<p>- Use Higher timeframes to find the true bottoms/tops.</p>
<p>- When the chart is about to test the channel, don't take any trades until you see a confirmation. It will either gets rejected from trying to break the channel or breaks the channel it will pull back and test before taking off</p>
<p>- In a down trend (Oscillator is going down), set up your long trades, yet still can look for epic shorts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- In an up trend (Oscillator is going up), setup your shorts, yet still can look for epic longs</p>
<p>- Trade with the daily trend. &nbsp;setup the trades on all the timeframes and line them up with each other</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- A little movement on the daily like crossing a SR are massive movements on the 1 hr. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- A bounce on the 4hr is huge on the 1 hr.</p>
<p>- Wait for the chart to establish a trend then bet with the trend and it almost impossible to loose. it will present several entries for you along a trend. &nbsp;these can be entry points and/or a place to load into your existing trade. buy the dips and sell the tops. Use multiple timeframes and you can see very easy when is good. get them all going in the same direction and look for the setup on the 1hr</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">Trading Advice:</mark></h1>
<p>- The most important thing to remember is to always go with the trend. Always look what the 4hr is doing. If 4 hour is in up trend look for longs on the 1 hour, if it is in a reversal wait. if it is in a down trend, look for shorts. The best trades to catch are shorts in a downtrend and longs in an uptrend.</p>
<p>- Think before you enter any trade. Think about the other possibilities of the trade and think about the bigger picture using MTF analysis. And most importantly, think about other trades that are against you too.</p>
<p>- It's all about getting perfect entries. Nothing else matters really. Once you start entering the good trades, Boom Trades, it will be all you want.</p>
<p>- Don't bother paper trading, It is like playing poker without money. If you want to practice trading make a real trade but very very little amount. Traders can often convince themselves that it is definitely going bull or for sure it will turn bear. It gets to the point where they will fight anyone who says otherwise. &nbsp;There are only two choices, up or down, this makes it easy to prepare for both options no matter what happens. Even if your analysis is wrong, you can still be prepared for the other move and can trade accordingly.</p>
<p>- It is important to learn patience. Many traders are in a hurry to make profits.</p>
<p>- Emotions: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; The biggest emotion to overcome is the fear of loosing out. It is easy to feel like you are missing the good trades but remember it always comes back for more entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; The second-biggest emotion to overcome is greed. Traders can stay in trades too long hoping for another boom, only for it to dump on them loosing all their profit.</p>
<p>- You only need to worry about trend if you try to ride the whole trend, if you are entering the break, trend is not important.</p>
<p>- Wait for the trend to be established and bet with it.</p>
<p>- Use diversions (hard to read when in a reversal). If the boom is going down and the price action is going up on the chart, there is a chance for a pump into a dump. And the opposite is correct.</p>
<p>- You have to treat your account like it is a big account!</p>
<p>- When trading Boom trads, DON'T use stop losses, because of the spikes and stop loss hunting. Stop Loss is a take loss! You can just exit if its not good trade or exit at a good place and in profit. Just put the Stop Loss near your liquidation price. Use them as take profits not as take losses</p>
<p>- Sometime, the retest after the real break of the trend line can pull all the way down before taking off</p>
<p>- If you miss the trade, just wait. It'll comes back</p>
<p>- If you enter early, you will get punished. Be patient and enter on on confirmation. An early entry is like picking a race horse before a race! I prefer to wait until they get around the first corner before I place a bet.</p>
<p>- If you made the mistake, let your trade play out before you close it.</p>
<p>- If you want to go for an early entry, entry with a small amount, then limp in and load in after the confirmation. Then another load in when it confirms again</p>
<p>- Don't bother checking anything but your trend lines. tinker on the breakout to the perfect entry. Draw lines on your charts to help you get the big picture, do not just rely on boom hunter.</p>
<p>- Use multi time frame analysis. Because, you could enter a short trades on shorter timeframes but it's &nbsp;just a pullback for the longer charts. in this case, the short setup on the higher time frame is more important than the long trades on the Lower timeframes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Don't enter a short trade into a pullback. It will bounce back up on you. Enter booms instead</p>
<p>- Once you enter a trade just stick with it. At some point it will confirm yes or no. Never ever exit until confirmation</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; If its a NO, look for exit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; If it is a YES, load into it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Never trade on an empty stomach. it affects your trading emotions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">About Swing traders (Range trading):</mark></h1>
<p>- Sideways action is for 5min swing traders not for boom hunters</p>
<p>- You can see the indicator trigger line is moving within the red and gray wave. That is a sideway action</p>
<p>- Trading the under 5min and over 1 hr charts are different games but the same. Things happen faster in the 5mins, or less, so you don't have time to make your moves like when trading on a 4hr. So stop losses are much more important because a little move on the 4hr chart is huge on the 5min chart. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Look for the break on the 1h and then look at 15 and 5 for entries. Or just enter off the 1 hr like a boss &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Use a stop loss when Sculping. Drop it at 25% with a limit order not a market order.</p>
<p>- Never put in more than 1% of your account in a sculp trade.</p>
<p>- As the bar goes up and breaks lines, move your Stop Loss up in profit</p>
<p>- If you want to exit the sculp, move the Stop Loss to the top of bar and let it hit it.</p>
<p>- When Scalping, always keep your Stop Loss in profit, just in case</p>
<p>- Doable in the smaller time frame. Draw a channel and enter at the support, Exit at the top</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Reversal Trading:</mark></h1>
<p>- Reversal trading is trading against the trend. &nbsp;Not advised at all as it could just be a false breakout after all)</p>
<p>- Reversal periods are hard to read because there is so much pressure going in both directions. You will get mixed signals. Once the reversal is complete the entries are easy and all the indicators are more accurate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Have patience and DO NOT enter reversals, just wait! They are rough waters. Not every movement in the market is worth trading or you will loose. Pick the good movement and wait.</p>
<p>- Don't try to catch a falling knife</p>
<p>- Be careful entering a short in an up trend. The natural path to travel is still up even if it breaks under the trend line.</p>
<p>- However, if you really want to trade reversals: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Have a reverence point. e.g. previous resistance/support</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; In a reversals, oscillators are turning in both directions. Wait for them to all go the same way. Wait for the trend reversal to complete and the waves to settle down and clean up &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Stop loss beyond the reference point. but be in the lookout for Stop Loss hunting and false breakouts &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Don't be greedy! trade very small part of your account, 1%.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale-out (TP in stages) or sell all at the nearest swing low (when going long in an up trend)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Risk Management:</mark></h1>
<p>- Never go short as it is breaking a channel or a SR line or after the first bull run. Wait and see what happen. It will either fly off or it will pull right back to retest the line and get rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;Either Take Profit at the top and get back in as it flies or pull out some positions at the top, TP1, and load them back in at the bottom as it breaks.</p>
<p>- When trading a boom, don't trade more than 10x and 10% of your trading account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Planing Ahead:</mark></h1>
<p>- Today, set up trades for next week.</p>
<p>- If you plan ahead you will never miss a trade and it is hard to make wrong decision. Stay open to all options and enter on confirmation.</p>
<p>- Set up longs on a HTF while you are doing shorts. Then wait for the break and enter longs on a faster timeframes. As is above so is below.</p>
<p>- 1h setup is for the direction of the trades on lower timeframe</p>
<p>- 4hr is killer on the fast frames. If you set up a trade on a 4hr chart, the trades on the 5min chart will be insane</p>
<p>- Always draw the next setup (using a Trend line). Set alerts for the trigger to cross the trend line. It will give you time to open/close a trade and plan the next break</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About MTF analyses:</mark></h1>
<p>- Look at all the timeframes and find the active ones</p>
<p>- Try to line up all the timeframes and find an entry on a lower timeframe (long or short). However, It is not easy to get all the timeframes aligned! that is why I don't trade much.</p>
<p>- When entering a trade you must have no doubts. They don't have to all go in same direction though. They just have to give the same message. But it helps when daily, weekly and monthly are in same direction. For example, if the monthly and weekly are heading upwards and the daily just crossed a Red SR and the 4hr just finished a pull back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Any indicator is a consolidation of whatever is happening on the chart. &nbsp;Simply put, on 4H and 1H, the indicator tells stories that do not necessarily overlap</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Channels:</mark></h1>
<p>- Price action moves through parallel channel at all time. So tracking it can help you plan trades well in advance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Tracking the current channel means you already know the options</p>
<p>- Price will bounce in channel till it breaks a support or a resistance line; these are the top and bottom line on boom hunter indicator. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- When it breaks through, price will bounce through next layer and head in the same direction... every time! &nbsp;</p>
<p>- It keeps doing this until it makes a wedge or breakout pattern. When it breakout, it makes new channel in new direction</p>
<p>- parallel channels keep getting halves with channels with in them. There are infinite SR lines on a chart. Every chart is just channels within channels</p>
<p>- Bull channels (Descending channel, facing down) will eventually break in upward direction. It is a long setup.</p>
<p>- Bear channels &nbsp;(Ascending channel, facing up) will eventually break in downward direction. It is a short setup.</p>
<p>- Avoid entering any trades while it is still changing direction and moving between channels. Safest bet is to wait for it to clean up and confirm change of direction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Patterns:</mark></h1>
<p>- Chart patterns work great on Boom Hunter XL oscillator. e.g. double top/bottom patterns, triangles, wedges, flags, trend lines, Ascending/Descending channels, head and shoulders....</p>
<p>- If the oscillator is going down connect some pivot highs. It is a long setup.</p>
<p>- If oscillator is going up connect some pivot lows. It is a short setup.</p>
<p>- The best patterns are the continuation one. go with the same trend showing in the higher time frames</p>
<p>- if you are new to breakout trading, draw a line on your chart too. It will help you to learn them better</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Pressure Dots:</mark></h1>
<p>- The pressure dots show when the price action is testing a support or resistance lines. Only the areas that are pushing hard on a SR get the dots</p>
<p>- The less pressure dots the more likely it will pivot and the price action will bounce away</p>
<p>- 1 pressure dot signals that it has hit a line and then bouncing from it. It is a strong signal. 1-3 dots makes a great pivot bounce from the SR. If it pushes too long it breaks the SR</p>
<p>- The more pressure dots the more likely it will pull back and push the SR line again or it may break the channel and continue upwards/downward. You can scalp these pump and dumps but the best entries come from getting in as it bounces from a red SR</p>
<p>- The more downward pressure the more green dots there are ( green dots = downward pressure)</p>
<p>- The more upward pressure the more red dots there are (red dots - upward pressure)</p>
<p>- For entry, wait for the pressure to stop and the reversal to confirm</p>
<p>- If the Boom Hunter XL Oscillator starts dragging on the top or bottom it will try to push again</p>
<p>- When the oscillator comes down on an easy slope with pressure it is likely it pushes again.</p>
<p>- Wait for the pressure to stop before entering trades and catch the first pull back after. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Never enter any trades until the pressure stops</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About the Oscillator, Trigger, and price line:</mark></h1>
<p>- The Gray Line (the Trigger) is a COG line. It is also the price line</p>
<p>- The White Line &nbsp;(the Oscillator) is the SMA of the trigger line</p>
<p>- The Price line does changes color:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- There are two oscillators on the price line, The main oscillator and &nbsp;The confirmation oscillator. They both have to go in same direction to be solid. that can help jumping on trends or riding them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; It will stay transparent green while in up trend and when oscillator moves up it turns solid green</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; It will stay transparent red while in down trend and when oscillator moves down it turns solid red</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Use back test mode to see how it changes</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Use the price line to determine the direction and the trend. Also use it to see what SR it is testing and how it is reacting to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About the Red &amp; Gray SR lines:</mark></h1>
<p>- Crossover or under any SR bands with pressure dots is a strong signal.</p>
<h2>- <strong>The Red band/line is a dynamic SR (shows the general trend's direction and behaviour)</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The price action will either bounces off it to change directions and to make a movement, sling shot from it, bounce off it. or launch through it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;If the oscillator is above the red band/line, it is an up trend and if it is below it's a down trend.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;Expanding the red SR gives a wider SR band. It helps filter out sideways action as it makes it very clear and it also gives an indication of the strength of the SR. The wider the stronger.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;You can tell the price is going to drop when the pivot high of the red SR line, itself, is lower than the last Red SR line pivot high. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;you can tell the price is going to pump when the pivot low of the red SR line, itself, is higher than the last Red SR line pivot low</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -When in doubt, just use the last two pivots.</p>
<h2>- <strong>The Gray band/line is a stronger less dynamic SR (COG length 50)</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;The gray band shows medium term support/resistance and general trend.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;When the white line (the Oscillator) is above the gray line ,it's an up trend. And when it gets pushed under it, it's a down trend.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;The price action can never get too far away from the Gray band. This band is much harder to cross as it works like a magnet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;Price action can easily bounce within the Gray band or get rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About the Top and Bottom SR Lines:</mark></h1>
<p>- Boom Hunter XL tracks the price parallel channel it is in.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;The bottom line is the support line (teal color) &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; The top line is resistance line (red) for the parallel channel it is in.</p>
<p>- When the bottom line is hitting the roof, that tells you that the price is testing the resistance of the current channel it's in.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- It signals that it has broke trough resistance and can go for a fly.</p>
<p>- When the top line is hitting the ground, that tells you that price is testing the support of the current channel it is in.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- it signals that it has broke trough support and can go for a dump.</p>
<p>- With just a little pressure (the line just spikes), it will make a good pivot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- With too much pressure (the line flatlined too long), it means that it broke the channel and it become a pump/dump. in this case, It will pull back and test the line before pumping/dumping again. Don't enter any trades there.</p>
<p>- Resistance line is still bottomed down = testing support</p>
<p>- Support line is still roofed up = testing resistance &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Volume Pressure Analysis:</mark></h1>
<p>- Use the volume bars when you are entering a trade. they confirms entries and continuations (The bounce and the breaakout)</p>
<p>- The lighter colors show how easy it is to move the price. It will fill up the bar first, once it is full it continues from above. This usually happens as it gets pushed and pulled from SR lines.</p>
<p>- The dimmed bars are Relative Volume (RVOL) bars that fall under the sma20 line and have little impact on the chart.</p>
<p>- The arrows show the directional pressure that price action wants to follow in. They confirm the bounces and the breakouts.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Red arrows signal downward directional pressure</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Green arrows signal upward directional pressure</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- These signals can go on and off as more data comes in. So wait near the end of a bar close for the bar it to collect enough information. It uses volume, so every bar starts with zero information and collects data as it is nearing the close. The closer you are to bar close the more accurate the data is. The start of a new bar does not have as accurate data as half way through a bar or near the closing of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Volume breakout (LSMA Yellow Dots)</mark></h1>
<p>- The yellow dot at the top of the indicator is a Volume Breakout. It is not a signal.</p>
<p>- Only enter at this dot if you were planning on entering the trade anyway. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- You should know the direction of the breakout already if you were planning to enter a trade. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About the Back testing practice:</mark></h1>
<p>- Use 1 hour to look for booms setups &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Back test using the Replay function on TradingView. Replay the chart and watch it in boom hunter to learn how the indicator work. Stop the replay often to draw lines as you go. watch out for breaks to learn the behaviour of the retest</p>
<p>- Back test entries in the right environment. No reversals.</p>
<p>- Look for shorts in downtrend and longs in uptrend.</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Alerts:</mark></h1>
<p>- <strong>Crossover</strong>: Cross over of the main oscillator</p>
<p>-<strong> Crossunde</strong>r: Cross under of the main oscillator</p>
<p>- <strong>Crossover Red SR</strong>: Main Oscillator crosses over the red SR band</p>
<p>- <strong>Crossunder Red SR</strong>: Main Oscillator crosses under the red SR band.</p>
<p>- <strong>Crossover With Pressure:</strong> Main oscillator crosses over while there is pressure (green dots)</p>
<p>- <strong>Crossunder With Pressure</strong>: Main oscillator crosses under while there is pressure (red dots)</p>
<p>- <strong>Testing Resistance:</strong> Bottom support line (oversold) hits the ceiling, signalling price action is testing resistance line of current price channel.</p>
<p>- <strong>Testing Support:</strong> Top resistance line (overbought) bottoms out, signalling price action is testing support line of current price channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- You can also set the alert to be ore specific. e.g.:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp;When the Oscillator Crossing the SR Wave 1 Median.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp;When the Trigger Crossing the SR Wave 2 Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Organized up to here!</h1>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About the Exit and Reloading Strategy:</mark></h1>
<p>- Most real booms will go straight to the bottom or top on the indicator then pull back for another push.</p>
<p>- To exit a trade, Either get out fully at the top and renter at pullback, or just pull some positions at top/bottom then throw them back in at the top/bottom of pullback ( incase it doesn't look like a straight forward entry)</p>
<p>- If it pushes hard a second time, prepare for a third push. Eventually it will make a bear or bull pattern and break it, depending if it is a short or long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">- About Tesla Coil:</mark></h1>
<p>- Use Boom Hunter XL to setup a trade and use Telsa Coil as an early signal, use it as volatility alert. It helps if yo already know the direction. Something is about to happen when the tesla coils shrinks</p>
<p>- flips polarity means that the chart will move from top channel to bottom channel or vice versa (the channel you draw)</p>
<p>- The problem during reversal periods is that the waves cant get clean pullbacks and the implosion/explosion happens out of sync</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><mark class="marker-yellow">Other Quotes:</mark></h1>
<p>- Riding a pump and dump is only fun if you have entered from a top or bottom. which is rare. Don't try to catch a falling knife</p>
<p>- Never just drop 20% of your balance into anything from the beginning. Limping in is fine</p>
<p>- Never do Cross, Always trade with Isolated mode! Cross means it can take your whole stack when liquidation.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;if i had to trade a reversal, my first entry will be on confirmation of that reversal, a low leverage position where the plan is to keep stacking in as it tests.</p>
<p>- Do not get greedy and over invest.</p>
<p>- It never pays to be greedy when you scalp. the trades always take off when you close</p>
<p>- Do not use leverage higher than 10x and do not invest more than 10% of your account at any time. If you have a large account do not do more than 5x and 5%.a more sensible option is 3x 3%.</p>
<p>- I only like to enter 100% trades that are easy. Everything else is a waste of time to me. its like scratching around the bottom of a bin for 1 cent.</p>
<p>- On a boom, I am happy to put in 10-20% of my stack in the first entry depending on how it looks. If i trade anything else, I will never put in more than 1% of my account</p>
<p>- If you just want to practice your entries, you can sculp by keeping an eye on the 5 min and 15m. Just bet small. it is way better than paper trading.</p>
<p>- Long pull backs work different in a downtrend than in an up trend. In a down trend, it's like its pumping the brakes. While in an up trend, Its like its kicking away.</p>
<p>- Keep in mind that things are different when trading in a bear and a bull market. The pressure from resistance is the opposite of support.</p>
<p>- Think of the price action like a rubber band. The long action is like pulling back a rubber band and letting go. While the short actions is like pushing the rubber band down and letting go. It is a different mechanism. The resistance is always restrictive while the support is expansive.</p>
<p>- If you are always planning setups, they will always be coming around.</p>
<p>- No trading on sideways action.</p>
<p>- You are going to have lots of shitty trades if you try to hit every movement, plan ahead.</p>
<p>- I have yet to meet a person that went broke locking in profits. Don't be greedy.</p>
<p>- Best Boom trades can be 100-200% profit each boom. They come every 2-8 weeks on BTC hourly chart.</p>
<p>- You can only loose money if you liquidate, hit a stop loss or close in the red. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- If you get dumped on after you enter a long and get liquidate,d you are using too much leverage and making bad entries.</p>

<p>- Pro tip: you can set one indicator on 20 or 27(main oscillator length) on the 4h and just ride the trends</p>
<p>- I used to boom hunt with a ema20 ema 50 and sma 200 line on my chart only.</p>
<p>- It's never a smooth ride! unless you get a good entry of course</p>
<p>- the only time I use the chart is for deep analysis. Otherwise. i read boom hunter</p>
<p>- If you limp in, bet something that wont care if it is a yes or no kinda trade. And no Stop Losses on 15m or lower. Just exit on the confirmation that its a bad trade and you hardly loose and sometimes in profit.</p>
<p>- limp in. &nbsp;get the early entry with low bet then when it takes off add to it. every time it re-confirms add to it. limping in also means it does not hurt if you mess it up.</p>
<p>- always look what the 4hr is doing. if 4 hour is in up trend look for longs on the 1 hour, if it is in a reversal wait. if it is in a down trend look for shorts. Go with the trend.</p>
<p>- pick the waves. Enter 1 hour booms.enter 4 hr booms.and ride the trend or just get out early. load in as it keeps confirming. you can have 50% of your stack in by the time you close with no risk</p>
<p>- just trend lines, channels, break lines, fib lines. you may want to use some ema lines to help visualize its movements (20, 50 and sma 200 to find the booms) but they are not accurate and get fake ones and miss entries too. usually after a crossover it has to pull back and test so if you enter into a crossover you go straight into red.</p>
<p>- Every trader should know how to do a fib retracement.</p>
<p>- when you see a daily or weekly or 4hr trying to change direction just wait for it to do it. then look for a setup on the 1 hr. always bet with the trend. at a pivot the trend is not decided. after the pivot on the weekly it will need to eventually pull back to stamp the trend line. this is a great confirmation of trend</p>
<p>- practice on the 1 min. its pullbacks all day long. drop an ema20/21 and go to town. trade the setups and practice entering first pullback</p>
<p>- Trade with the daily trend. &nbsp;setup the trades on all the timeframes and line them up with each other</p>
<p>- A little movement on the daily like crossing a SR are massive movements on the 1 hr. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- A bounce on the 4hr is huge on the 1 hr.</p>
<p>- In an up trend the support line is active while the resistance is passive. This swaps in a down trend. The support and resistance lines are always active and passiv</p>
