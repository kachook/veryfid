<p>The COG Oscillator (center of gravity) is an indicator based on statistics and the Fibonacci golden ratio. It uses <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/arnaudlegoux/">ALMA</a> as a trigger and <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/lsma/">LSMA</a> as a "zero line." The trigger is set tight by default but can be tweaked by adjusting the window size and sigma in settings. This is a great indicator for setting up trades and spotting reversals. There are 2 main strategies that come with this indicator:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 1: </strong>Long positions are entered when the current low point is higher than the previous low. Short positions are entered as the current high is lower than the previous high. (Shown in the image above)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Strategy 2: </strong>If a market is <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/bullish/">bullish</a> long trades are entered as the COG line crosses over the red <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/lsma/">LSMA</a> line. Traders have the option of scalping the first crossover or even scaling out of trade to close on the second exit. This works the opposite for shorts when the market is <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/bearish/">bearish</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try to look for parallel channels for the biggest breakouts. Also, try connecting 3 or more tops or bottoms to find breakouts.</p>

<p><br>A simple way with boom hunter is to check the low pivots:</p>

<p><br>Another easy way is with COG, use a clean theme then turn off all the lines in the style options but COG trend line. Set length to 50 and use smoothing with a length of 3:</p>
