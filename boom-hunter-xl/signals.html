<p>Signals and alerts for Boom Hunter XL are found on its own indicator <strong>Boom Hunter XL Signals </strong>which can be be found in the Trading View public library. This is an overlay indicator that you can drop on top of your chart or over the top of your Boom Hunter indicator. It displays many common and important signals found on the Boom Hunter XL indicator. These include first pullbacks, breakouts, overbought, oversold, pumps and dumps. Examples below are using Bitcoin Daily charts but work on all markets.</p>
<h1>First Pullbacks</h1>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Best Time frames: </strong>Any time frames.<strong> &nbsp; Signal Type:</strong> Entry Point. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>These are the one of the most important signals for traders to understand as these will provide great entries on all time frames. This alert is triggered when the oscillator makes its first pullback after crossing the Gray SR line. While these are great entries with an extremely high success rate it is still important to pick the strong trades and bet with the trend.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Breakouts</h1>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Best Time frames: </strong>1 hour and slower.<strong> &nbsp; Signal Type:</strong> Entry Point. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Breakouts are many traders favorite and for good reason, these trades are very exciting and can be very lucrative. This signal is triggered on the first pullback after price action breaks its trend support or resistance line. Entering this signal on faster time frames without using multiple time frames for analysis can have mixed results as a breakout on a fast time frame can be a pullback for a slower time frame heading in the opposite direction. This means you may be entering into a pump and dump scenario. When this signal is found on a slower time frame like daily it is best to then use a faster time frame to find an appropriate entry when margin trading, Breakout entries are can be tricky for inexperienced traders as these movements are highly volatile and can bounce around before taking off. I recommend not using stop losses when entering these trades or if you do make sure it is very far from price action with no possibility of getting hit. Breakouts are a hotspot new traders and institutional traders enter. New traders are looking for that big win and will enter trades over leveraged with tight stop losses at the worst places possible. Institutional traders also want to enter the breakout but first they need to create liquidity. To do this they first need to go short to go long, this is commonly referred to as “stop loss hunting”. Stop loss hunting is a myth for the most part. The chart mechanics of a breakout dictate that price action must make these moves to setup the breakout. Institutional traders have to trade like they do to fill their positions and it just so happens new traders like to get in the way and give them money. If traders just refrain from using a stop loss they cant get “hunted”, not only that it will also mess up institutional traders who will struggle to find the liquidity for their trades. Stop losses are invented by exchanges to take your money, they are called stop losses but the reality is they are "take losses" and there could not be a worse place or way to exit your trade. After entering a trade wait for price action to move in your favor and break some support and resistance, at this point you can put a stop loss in profit. This will lock in your profits and make it impossible to loose. If you use leverage you need to consider that you need to pay the fees for the total loan. These fees are calculated separately from your profit and loss so even if you think you are winning there is a good chance you are actually loosing money. The more leverage you use the more profits you need to make to break even, for example depending on which exchange you use for a 5x trade you may need to make 4% to breakeven but using 50x you will need to make around 100% profit just to breakeven. Do not enter these trades over-leveraged or it will be a rough ride. If price moves against your favor wait for it to confirm an opposite move on slower time frames. Once the move is confirmed you can find an appropriate place to exit your trade. Be patient and trade smart.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Overbought and Oversold (name changed to “reversal” on Boom Hunter X)</h1>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Best Time frames: </strong>1 hour and slower.<strong> &nbsp; Signal Type:</strong> Exit Point. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While at first glance these may look like great entries but these signals are better used for exits, scaling out of trades and adjusting trailing stop losses. This is a great way to find market tops and bottoms. The Boom Hunter XL Signals indicator uses a length of 4 to find these signals while Boom Hunter XL uses a default length of 10. You can change these in the settings and tune it how you like. This alert will trigger when price action stops pushing on its channel support or resistance and can be seen on the Boom Hunter XL indicator when the support or resistance line returns.</p>

<h1>Pumps and Dumps</h1>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Best Time frames: </strong>2 hour and slower.<strong> &nbsp; Signal Type:</strong> Entry Point. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A pump or dump movement happens after price action has broke or is pushing a channel SR. A dump can be found on Boom Hunter XL when the oscillator crosses under with down pressure (green dots). Likewise a pump can be found when the oscillator crosses over with up pressure (red dots). These movements can be very small on fast time frames and it can make for a dangerous entry as this movement usually happens before a reversal. Set alerts on 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, 12hr and Daily and then find an entry on faster time frames like 15m.</p>

<h1>Setting Alerts</h1>
<p>When setting alerts for these signals it is good to use the appropriate signals for the time frames you are using. You don't need an alert for every signal on every time frame. A good alert setup for an active trader should include multiple time frames. Signals from slower time frames are used to determine the direction and movement of price action while faster time frames are used for entering trades. Below is an example of alerts to set and how to use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Slow Time frames</h3>
<p>Set alerts for all the signals on slower time frames, these include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>First pullbacks</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Pump and dumps</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Breakouts</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Overbought and oversold</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These signals work great on the following time frames:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily</strong></li>
  <li><strong>4Hr</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Weekly</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Monthly</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like more signals you can also use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>12hr</strong></li>
  <li><strong>8hr</strong></li>
  <li><strong>2hr</strong></li>
  <li><strong>2D</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you receive an alert for these signals make sure you do analysis before entering.<strong> You will get best results if you enter your trade using the 15m, 30m and 1hr charts. </strong>Alerts on very slow time frames like weekly and monthly will help you determine what strong trades to look for in the upcoming days/weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Fast Time frames</h3>
<p>Only set alerts for entry signals on faster time frames, these include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>First pullbacks</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Breakouts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These signals work great on the following time frames:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1hr</strong></li>
  <li><strong>30m</strong></li>
  <li><strong>15m</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you receive an alert for these signals make sure you do analysis before entering a trade. Look at charts using multiple time frames to confirm it is a strong trade.<strong> You do not need to hit every movement, just the good ones. </strong>First pullbacks are the best entry, be prepared when entering breakouts. <strong>Trade smart.</strong></p>
